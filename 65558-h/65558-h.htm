<h3>WHAT DOROTHY SAW</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Stepping out of the train in the wake
of Tom, Dorothy was at once caught in
the crowd on Paddington arrival platform.
She was pushed and squeezed and buffeted,
but her eyes were shining, and her face was
all smiles, for she felt that she was seeing life
at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew! Some crowd, isn’t it?” panted
Tom, as a fat man laden with a great bundle
of rugs and golf clubs barged into him from
behind, while a lady carrying a yelling infant
charged at him from the side, and catching
him unawares, sent him lurching against
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was sturdy, and stood up to the impact
without disaster, only saying in a breathless
fashion, “Oh, Tom, what a lot of people!
Where do you expect they all come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t say. You had better ask ’em,”
Tom chuckled, as he sprang for the nearest
taxi, and secured it too, although a ferocious
looking man, with brown whiskers like a doormat,
was calling out that he wanted that
particular vehicle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy meanwhile secured a porter, and
extricating Tom’s luggage and her own from
the pile on the platform, the things were
bundled into the taxi; she and Tom tumbled
in after them, and they were moving away from
the platform before the angry person with
doormat whiskers had done making remarks
about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what I call a good get-away,” Tom
sighed with satisfaction, lolling at ease in his
corner. “You will have time to buy your finery
now, without any danger of our missing the
train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you, I should have taken the time
in any case, whether we lost the train or not,”
rejoined Dorothy calmly. Then she asked, with
a twinkle in her eye, “Are you coming to help
me choose the frock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not me; what should I be likely to know
about a girl’s duds?” and Tom looked as
superior as he felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy leant back laughing. “Sometimes
you talk as if you know a lot,” she said mischievously.
“Do you remember Brenda Gomme
and the marigold satin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom grinned, but stuck to it that he had not
been so far wrong in calling the thing marigold,
seeing that it was yellow, and marigolds were
yellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roses are red—sometimes,” she answered
crisply; “for all that we do not call all red
things rose colour. Hullo! is this Victoria
already? See, Tom, we will cloakroom
everything we’ve got, and then we shall be
able to enjoy ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When this was accomplished, and the taxi
paid, the two plunged into the busy streets
outside Victoria, walking briskly along, and
stopping occasionally to ask the way to the
great multiple shop to which they were bound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There it is! Look, Tom!” There was
actual rapture in Dorothy’s tone as she
pranced along, waving her hand excitedly
in the direction of the big plate-glass windows
of Messrs. Sharman and Song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the door of the lift she paused to beg
Tom to come with her; but he, his attention
caught by a window filled with football
requisites, was already engrossed, and turned
a deaf ear to her pleading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was shot up in the lift to the next
floor, and was at once thrilled and half-awed
by the splendid vista of showrooms stretching
away before her enchanted gaze. Then a
saleswoman took her in hand, and she plunged
at once into the business of buying a little
frock for evening wear, with the tip kind old
Aunt Louisa had given to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The frocks displayed were too grown-up
and elaborate for a schoolgirl. Dorothy knew
what she wanted, and was not going to be
satisfied until she got it. The saleswoman
went off in search of something more simple,
and for the moment Dorothy was left alone
staring into the long looking-glass, not seeing
her own reflection, but watching the people
moving about the showroom singly and in
groups: it was so early in the day that there
were no crowds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw a girl detach herself from a group
of people lower down the room, and wander
in and out in an aimless fashion between the
showcases. Suddenly the girl halted by a table
piled with pretty and costly jumpers. Stooping
over them for a moment she swiftly slid
one out of sight under her coat, and with a
leisurely step turned back past a big case to
join her party.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/img001.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0001' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'>She swiftly slid a jumper under her coat</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy gave a little gasp of dismay. It
had been so quickly done that at first she
did not realize she had been watching a very
neat piece of shoplifting. Then she sprang
forward to meet the saleswoman, who was
coming towards her with an armful of frocks.
She was going to denounce that girl who was
a thief, she was just opening her lips to cry
out that a jumper had been stolen, she looked
round to see where the girl was, but the light-fingered
one had gone—vanished as completely
as if she had never been—and Dorothy was
struck dumb. If the girl had escaped out of
the room, of what use to accuse her? Even
if she were still in the building she might
easily have passed the stolen garment on to
some one else. Then it would be her word
against Dorothy’s accusation. There would
be an awful fuss, her journey would be delayed
Tom would be furious, and——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you will like these better, Moddom,”
the voice of the saleswoman cut into Dorothy’s
agitated thinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hesitated, and was lost. She could not
make a disturbance by telling what she had
seen—she simply could not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the time she was choosing her frock she
felt like a thief herself. Half her pleasure in
her purchase vanished, and she was chilled as
if the sun had gone behind a cloud, leaving
the day drear and cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of this the garment was as satisfactory
as it could be, and the price was so
reasonable that there was a margin left over
for shoes and stockings to wear with the frock.
Oh, life was not such a tragedy after all, and
Dorothy hugged her parcel with joy as she
went down in the lift to join Tom, who was
still absorbed by the window filled with football
things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you buy up the shop?” he asked, as
they went off briskly in search of lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no; it would have needed a pretty
long purse to do that,” she said with a laugh;
and then she burst into the story of the shoplifting
she had seen, asking Tom what he would
have done if he had been in her place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yelled out, ‘Stop thief!’ and have been
pretty quick about it too,” he answered with
decision, as they settled down at a corner table
in a quiet little restaurant for lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I could not!” There was real distress
in Dorothy’s tone. “The girl was so nice to
look at, and she was well-dressed too. Oh,
Tom, how could she have stooped to such
meanness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Women are mostly like that.” Tom wagged
his head with a superior air as he spoke.
“It is very few women who have any sense
of honour; I should say it is peculiar to the sex.
When boys and girls have games together the
girls always cheat, and expect the boys to sit
down under it. It is the same in the mixed
schools; the girls expect to get by thieving
what the boys have to work hard for. When
they are older, and ought to know better, it is
still the same; they expect to have what they
want, and if they can’t get it by fair means,
why, they get it by foul. They don’t care so long
as they get it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy stared at him for a moment as if
amazed at his outburst; then she laughed
merrily, and told him he was a miserable old
cynic, who ought to be shut up in a home for
men only, and be compelled to cook his own
food and darn his own socks to the end of the
chapter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, in that case I shouldn’t be going
back to school to-day, with the prospect of
being invited over to the girls’ house every
fortnight or so during the term—rather jolly
that would be.” Tom winked at his sister as
he spoke, and then they laughed together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should feel just awful at the prospect
of Compton Schools if you were not going to
be there too,” she said with a little catch of
her breath; and then she cried out that they
must hurry, or they would certainly be late for
the train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a scramble to get their things out of
the cloakroom, to get on to the platform, and
to find a place in the Ilkestone train. At first
they had to stand in the corridor, then a voice
from farther along the corridor called to them
“Tom Sedgewick, there is room for one here
Is that your sister? Bring her along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of our crowd are down there; come
along and be introduced,” said Tom, catching
Dorothy by the hand and hurrying her forward.
“It is Hazel Dring, and Margaret Prime is
with her. They are pals—if you see one, you
may be sure the other is not far off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hazel Dring was a tall girl with fair hair
and a very nice smile. Margaret Prime was
smaller, a quiet girl with a rather shrinking
manner, as if she was afraid of being snubbed,
Both of them greeted Dorothy in the friendliest
fashion. They made room for her to sit with
them, although they were already crowded; and
they were so kind that she had to be glad she
had met them on the train, although secretly
she would have chosen to be alone with Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not a scholarship girl, are you?”
asked Hazel. “You look nearly grown up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not clever enough for a scholarship
girl,” Dorothy answered with a little sigh;
“Tom has the brains in our family. I am
seventeen, and I am to have one year at the
Compton Schools.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just long enough to win the Lamb Bursary,”
cried Hazel eagerly. “I expect you will
be in the Sixth, you are so big; and if you
are, you will be eligible for the Mutton Bone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Mutton Bone!” Dorothy looked
puzzled, even frowning, as was her wont when
perplexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margaret laughed, then answered for Hazel.
“That is what we call the Lamb Bursary—a
term of affection, mind you. We would not
cry it down for worlds; it is the top strawberry
in the basket of the Compton Schools, and
there are a lot of us going to have a try for it
this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, I know the Lamb Bursary is a
prize worth having,” said Dorothy. “Tom
has talked about it, and groaned a lot because
there was not an equal gift for the boys. But
I don’t suppose I should have much chance
for it as I am not at all clever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that does not matter so much if you
are anything of a sticker at work,” said Hazel;
“the Lamb Bursary goes to the best all-round
scholar of the year. You might be very brilliant
in some subjects, but if you were a duffer at
others you would not stand a chance. For
instance, you might stand very high in mathematics,
you might be a prodigy in chemistry,
but if you had not decent marks for languages,
history, and music you would be left, for the
judging is on the averages of all the subjects.
It is really a very good way, as it gives quite
an ordinary girl a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by judging on the
averages?” asked Dorothy, frowning more
than before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way,” put in Margaret, whose business
in life seemed to be to supplement Hazel.
“You might get a hundred marks for maths;
well, eighty would be a good average, so you
would be put down for eighty. Say you only
got twenty for history; the twenty left over
from your maths average would be put to it,
but it would not bring you up to your average
of eighty, don’t you see? It is a queer way
of judging, and must give the staff and the
examiners no end of trouble, but it does work
out well for the girl who is plodding but not
especially clever. In most subjects one could
hope to make eighty out of a hundred, but oh!
it means swotting all the time. One can’t shirk
a subject that does not make much appeal,
because every set of marks must be up to the
average.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind work,” said Dorothy, her
frown disappearing, “but I’m not brilliant anywhere,
and that has been the trouble. The
Bursary sends you to Cambridge, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the full university course. Oh! it is
well worth trying for, even if one has little or
no chance of getting it.” Margaret’s face glowed
as she spoke, and Dorothy thought she was
really nice-looking when she was animated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Webster and Poole are wedged into a corner
along there; I am going to talk to them,” said
Tom, thrusting his head in from the corridor;
and then he went off, and Dorothy did not see
him again until the train slowed up at Claydon
Junction, where they had to change for Sowergate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quite a crowd of boys and girls poured out
of the London train, racing up the steps and
over the bridge to the other platform where
the little Sowergate train was waiting. Dorothy
went over with Margaret, while Hazel and Tom
stayed behind to sort out the luggage. There
was a wait of ten minutes or so. The carriage
was crowded out with girls, some of them new,
like Dorothy, and others, old stagers, who
swaggered a little by way of showing off.
The talk was a queer jumble of what they
had been doing in vac, of the hockey chances
of the coming term, and what sort of programme
they would have for social evenings.
Dorothy sat silent now; indeed she was feeling
rather lonely and out of it, for every one
was appealing to Margaret, and Hazel was at
the other end of the carriage, while Tom was
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rhoda Fleming has come back,” said a
stout girl who had flaming red hair, “I saw
her at Victoria. She says she is going to stay
another year, so that she can have a chance at
the Mutton Bone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will never win it,” chorused several.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She would stand a very good chance if
only she would work,” said Margaret quietly.
“Rhoda is really clever, and she has such a
good memory too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is like you to say a good word for her,
Meg, but she has snubbed you most awfully
in her time.” The red-haired reached out a
friendly hand to pat Margaret on the shoulder,
but Dorothy noticed that Margaret winced,
turning a distressful red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind who snubs me, provided
Hazel does not,” she said with a rather forced
laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is not much danger of my doing
that, kid.” Hazel nodded her head from the
other end of the carriage, and looked her
affection for her chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy thrilled. How beautiful it must
be to have a girl chum, and to love her like that.
She and Tom had always been great pals,
but she had never had a chum among girls.
Her own two sisters, Gussie and Tilda, otherwise
Augusta and Matilda, were four years
younger than herself, and being twins, were
in consequence all in all to each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then the train ran out of tunnel number
three, Dorothy caught sight of two flags
fluttering amid groups of trees on the landward
side of the railway track, and at that
moment a great roar of cheering broke out
along the train. The girls in the carriage
yelled with all their might, handkerchiefs
fluttered, and Dorothy wondered what was
happening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See those flags?” cried Margaret, seizing
her arm and shaking it violently. “They are
the school flags, and we are saluting them.
Now, then, yell for all you are worth!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Dorothy yelled, putting her back into
it too, for was she not also a Compton girl?</p>

<div><h1 id='chap02'>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<h3>A SHOCK</h3>

<p class='pindent'>A string of vehicles were drawn up outside
Sowergate Station—there were three
taxis, two rather dilapidated horse cabs, the
station bus, and four bath chairs. There
was a wild rush for these last by the girls in
the know, and when they were secured the
fortunate ones set off in a race for the school,
the chair-man who arrived first being promised
double fare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy, with Hazel, Margaret, the two
Goatbys, and little Muriel Adams were squeezed
into a taxi, and the luggage was taken up on a
lorry. The girls were a tight fit, as Daisy
Goatby was an out-size in girls; however, the
distance was short, so crowding did not matter.
They all cheered loudly when they passed the
labouring chair-men, who were making very
good way indeed, until one unlucky fellow,
in trying to pass another, tipped his chair over
in the ditch and spilled the passenger, though,
luckily, without doing any damage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy felt rather sore because Tom had
gone off without even saying good-bye, but
she was too proud to let the others know she
was hurt. There was such a bustle and commotion
on the platform and in the station that
no one would notice the omission but herself.
It was quite possible that Tom had forgotten
that he had not said good-bye to his sister, and
she strove to forget it herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were no conveyances for the boys.
Their school was so close to the station, they
had only to race across the rails, and then over
the road leading up to Beckworth Camp, and
the school gates were in front of them. But it
was nearly a mile up the steep little Sowergate
valley to the funny old house under the hill
where the girls had their school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy thought she had never seen such
a queer medley of buildings as the Compton
School for girls. It was built round in a half-circle
under the hill, and at first sight seemed
to consist chiefly of conservatories; but that
was because most of the rooms opened on to
a conservatory which ran the whole length of
the house, and served as a useful way of getting
from room to room. The place was very big,
and very rambling; it had lovely grounds, and
the sixty girls were lodged in the extreme of
comfort and airy spaciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was received by Miss Arden, the
Head, and by her handed over to the matron,
who allotted her a cubicle in No. 2 dormitory,
in company with Hazel, Margaret, and seven
other girls. It was half-past five by this time,
and matron said dinner was at six o’clock: it
was to be at this time to-day, as most of the
girls had been travelling, and had had no proper
meal since breakfast. By the time dinner was
over the luggage would have arrived, and there
would be unpacking to be done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was thankful to drop the curtains
of her cubicle, and to find herself alone for a
few minutes, it had been such a wildly exciting
sort of arrival. Even as she sank down for a
moment on the chair by the side of her bed
a great burst of cheering broke out, and she
looked out of the window to see that the first
bath chair had turned in past the lodge gate,
and was being uproariously welcomed by a
group of girls who were lingering on the step
of the hall door for that purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had to burst out laughing at the ridiculous
sight the chair-man presented, decked out
with coloured paper streamers round his hat
and a huge rosette pinned to his coat. He was
panting with his exertions, while his fare, still
seated in the chair, was haranguing them all
on her splendid victory, when two other chairs
came in at the gate, and were presently followed
by the last, which had been overturned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was only time for a wash and brush-up;
then, as the gong sounded, streams of girls
from various parts of the house poured in the
direction of the dining-hall. They streamed
along the conservatory that was so gay with all
sorts of flowers, and turned into the dining-hall
to meet another stream of girls coming from
dormitories No. 4 and No. 5, which were
reached by a different stairway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was with the girls coming through
the conservatory, she was looking at the flowers
as she was hurried along, and she was thinking
what a lovely place it was. There seemed to
be a great crowd of girls in the dining-hall, and
because it was the first meal of term, they were
a little longer getting to their places. The
various form-mistresses were busy drafting
them each to the right table, and Dorothy had
a sense of whirling confusion wrapping her
round, making all things unreal, while her
vision was blurred, and the sound of voices
seemed to come from ever so far away. Then
the sensation passed. She was herself again,
she was standing on one side of Hazel Dring,
while Margaret stood on the other, and she
lifted her eyes to look at her opposite neighbour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shiver of very real dismay shook her then,
for in the tall girl confronting her across the
table she recognized the girl who had stolen the
jumper in the showroom of the London shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, it surely, surely could not be the same!
Dorothy stared at her wide-eyed and bewildered.
Her gaze was so persistent and
unwinking that presently the girl looked at
her in annoyance, saying curtly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you staring at? Have you found
a black mark on my face?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy flushed. “I beg your pardon, I
was thinking I had seen you before.” She
stammered a little as she spoke, wondering what
answer she would make if the girl should ask
her where she had seen her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is hardly likely, I should think,”
answered the girl. Then, as if with intent to
be rude, she said coldly, “I have no acquaintance
with any of the scholarship girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy gasped as if some one had shot a
bowl of cold water in her face; she was fairly
amazed at the rudeness and audacity of the
girl, and she subsided into silence, while Hazel
said crisply,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dorothy Sedgewick is not a scholarship
girl, and until after the examination to-morrow
morning we do not even know whether she is
a dunce or not, so you need not regard her as a
possible rival until then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not afraid of rivals,” said the girl
with superb indifference; and Dorothy caught
her breath in a little strangled gasp as she
wondered what would happen if she were to
announce across the table that she had seen
this proud girl steal a silk jumper from the
showrooms of Messrs. Sharman and Song only
a few hours before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then a girl lower down the table leaned
forward and said, “I did not see you at Redhill
this morning, Rhoda; which way did you
come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl who had snubbed Dorothy turned
with a smile to answer the question. “I came
up to town with Aunt Kate, who was going to
do some shopping, and then I came on from
Victoria.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy’s gaze was fixed on the girl again:
it was just as if she could not take her eyes away
from her; and Rhoda, turning again, as if drawn
by some secret spell, flushed an angry red right
up to the roots of her hair. But she did not
speak to Dorothy—did not appear to see her
even; and the meal went on its way to the end,
while the girls chattered to each other and to
the mistresses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was that girl sitting opposite who was
so very rude?” asked Dorothy, finding herself
alone for a minute with Margaret when dinner
had come to an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was Rhoda Fleming,” answered Margaret;
then she asked, “Whatever did you say
to her to put her in such an awful wax?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only said that I thought I had seen her
before,” said Dorothy slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And had you?” asked Margaret, opening
her eyes rather widely, for there did not seem
anything in that for Rhoda to have taken umbrage
about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may have been mistaken.” Dorothy was
on her guard now. She might have told Rhoda
where she had seen her, had they been alone;
but to mention the matter to any one else was
unthinkable—it would be like uttering a libel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You succeeded in getting her goat up
pretty considerably,” said Margaret with a
little laugh. “You may always know that
Rhoda is pretty thoroughly roused when she
mentions scholarship girls—they are to her what
a red rag is to a bull. I am a scholarship girl
myself, and I have had to feel the lash of her
tongue very often.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?” Dorothy’s tone was frankly
amazed. “It is surely a great honour to be
a scholarship girl—to have won the way here
for yourself; I only wish I had been able to
do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, the cleverness part is all right,
although very often it is not so much cleverness
as adaptability, or luck pure and simple,” said
Margaret, who hesitated a minute; and then,
as if summoning her courage by an effort, went
on, “You see, the scholarship girls often come
up from the elementary schools. I did myself:
it was my only chance of getting here, for my
mother is a widow, and poor; she keeps a
boarding-house in Ilkestone. I am telling you
this straight off; it is only fair that you should
know. Seeing me with Hazel Dring, you might
think our social positions were equal, or at least
not so far apart as they really are. Hazel’s
people are rich. She has never in all her life
had to come within nodding distance of poverty,
or even of narrow means. But she chose me
for her chum, and we never trouble about the
difference in our positions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not; why should you?” Dorothy’s
tone was friendly—she had even slipped her
arm round Margaret’s waist—and was shocked
to see how the girl shrank and shivered as she
made her proud little statement of her position.
“If you will let me be your friend too, I shall
be very pleased and proud. My father is a
doctor, and he has to work very hard indeed
to feed, clothe, and educate his six children,
so there is certainly not much difference between
you and me, whatever there may be
between you and Hazel. But I am so surprised
to find that your home is in Ilkestone—why,
that is quite close, the next station on from
Claydon Junction—and yet you came from
London with Hazel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have spent all the vac at Watley with
Hazel. I was not very well last term,” explained
Margaret. “Mother is always so busy,
too, during the long hols that I am something
of an embarrassment at home; so it was an
all-round benefit for me to be away with Hazel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see.” Dorothy’s arm tightened a little
round the slender figure of Margaret as she
asked, “Then we are to be chums? I don’t
want to come between Hazel and you, of
course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would not,” said Margaret, glowing
into actual beauty by reason of her happy confidence
in her friend. “Hazel and I have
plenty of room in our hearts for other friends,
and even for chums. I felt you were going to
be friendly, that is why I screwed my courage
to make a clean breast about myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was quite unnecessary where I am
concerned, I can assure you.” Dorothy spoke
earnestly and with conviction; then she asked
a little uneasily, “Do you expect that Rhoda
Fleming will be in our dorm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied Margaret. “I am sure she
will not. She will be in No. 1; it is the same
size as ours, but there are better views from
the windows. She was there last term, and
will be certain to go back to her old place. She
said she was going to leave, so we are surprised
to find that she has come back for another
year. Here comes matron; that means we
have to go and get busy with unpacking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was later that same evening, and Dorothy
was standing at the window of the corridor outside
the door of the dorm watching the moon
making a track of silver on the distant sea,
when suddenly a tall girl glided up to her out
of the shadows, and gripping her by the arm,
said harshly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray, where was it that you thought you
had seen me before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl was Rhoda Fleming, and Dorothy
could not repress a slight shiver of fear at the
malice of her tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not think; I knew,” she answered
quietly, and she was quite surprised to hear
how unafraid her voice sounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, where was it?” Rhoda fairly hissed
out her question, and Dorothy shivered again,
but she answered calmly enough, “It was in
the showrooms of Messrs. Sharman and Song,
a little before one o’clock to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clutch on her arm became a vicious
pinch, as Rhoda said in strident tones, “You
are wrong, then, for I have not been near the
shop to-day; in fact, I have never been there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, that settles it, of course,” said
Dorothy quietly. “Please let my arm go,
you are hurting me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rats! Is your skin too tender to be
touched?” Rhoda’s tone was vibrant with
scorn, but her fingers relaxed their grip as she
went on, “Well, what was I doing when you
saw me there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That cannot possibly concern you, seeing
that you state you were not there,” said Dorothy
calmly, and then she moved away to join some
girls who had come out from No. 2 dorm, and
were on their way downstairs for prayers.
She was feeling that the less she had to do with
Rhoda Fleming the better it would be for her
happiness and comfort at the Compton Schools.
But how to avoid her without seeming to do
so would be the problem, and she went her
way down with the others, wearing a very sober
face indeed.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap03'>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<h3>PRIDE OF PLACE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning directly after breakfast,
Dorothy, in company with the other new
girls—about a dozen of them—went off to the
study of the Head, to be examined as to place
in the form, and general capacity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not usual for any girl, whatever her
age, to be received at once into the Sixth, and
Dorothy was accordingly given a Fifth Form
paper to fill. When she had done this, and it
had been passed to the Head by the form-mistress
who was assisting her, Miss Arden,
after reading down her answers, immediately
passed her another paper—and this a Sixth
Form one—to fill. This was a much stiffer
matter, and Dorothy worked away with absorbed
concentration, not even noticing that
the other girls had all done, and left the room.
But none of them had been given a second
paper, so she was to be forgiven for being the
last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Head was called for at that moment.
It was a couple of hours later before Dorothy
knew her fate. Meanwhile the whole of the
Sixth and the Upper Fifth were gathered in
the lecture hall for a lecture on zoophytes by
Professor Plimsoll, who was the natural history
lecturer for the Compton Schools. He was a
young man, and very enthusiastic. Dorothy
was so surprised to find how interesting the
subject could be made that she sat listening,
entranced by his eloquence, until a nudge from
Daisy Goatby, sitting next to her, recalled her
to her surroundings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take notes, duffer, take notes,” whispered
Daisy with quite vicious energy. “If you sit
staring like a stuck pig at my lord, you will get
beans when he has finished, and he has a way
of making one feel a very worm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy made a valiant effort to scribble
things on paper; but the next minute her head
was up again, and she was staring at the professor,
so absorbed in what he was saying that
she quite forgot Daisy’s kindly warning anent
the need of looking busy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All round her the girls were bent over their
notebooks industriously scribbling: some of
them were taking notes in writing they would
certainly not be able to read later. One or two
were writing to friends, but the main of them
were jotting down facts which should serve as
pegs on which to hang their ideas when they
had to write out what they could remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Plimsoll was suave in his manner,
a gentleman, but withal very hot-tempered, and
a terror to slackers. He noticed Dorothy’s
absorbed attention, and was at first rather
flattered by it; then observing that she took no
notes, and that her gaze had a dreamy quality,
as if her thoughts were far away, his temper
flared up, and he determined to make an
example of her. Nothing like beginning as he
meant to go on. If he allowed such a flagrant
case of laziness to pass unrebuked at the first
lecture of the term, what sort of behaviour
might he not have to put up with before the
end of the course?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was nearly at the end of his lecture, when
he stopped with dramatic suddenness, pointing
an accusing finger at Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The name of that young lady, if you please?”
he said with a little bow to the form-mistress,
who had come into the lecture with the girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is Dorothy Sedgewick,” answered
Miss Groome with a rather troubled air. She
was sorry that the professor should fall upon a
new girl at the first lecture of term; to her way
of thinking it did not seem quite fair play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Dorothy Sedgewick, may I beg of you
to step up here?” The professor’s tone was
bland—he was even smiling as he beckoned her
to come and stand by his side; but the girls
who had attended his lectures before knew very
well that he was simply boiling with rage, and
from their hearts pitied Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose in her place and walked forward.
She was still so absorbed in what she had been
listening to that she did not sense anything
wrong. It did not even seem strange to her
that she should be called forward. She was
the only new girl present at the lecture, and she
supposed it might be the ordinary thing for
fresh girls to be called forward in this fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you permit me to see the notes you
have taken?” he asked in a voice that was
curiously soft and gentle, although his eyes
were flashing. He held out his hand as he
spoke, and Dorothy handed him her notebook,
saying in an apologetic tone, “I am so sorry,
but I have not taken any notes, I was so
interested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Plimsoll permitted himself a smile,
and again his eyes flashed, just as if they were
throwing off little sparks. He glanced at
the blank page of the notebook, then gave it
back to her, saying in that curiously soft and
gentle tone, “Since you have been too interested
to take notes, perhaps you will be so
very kind as to tell us what you can remember
of the things I have been telling you; especially
I should be glad to hear what has interested
you most.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy looked at him in surprise; even
now, so restrained and controlled was his
manner, she did not realize how furiously angry
he was, but supposed that he had called her
out because of her being a new girl, and
that her position in the school would in some
way be determined by what she could do
now. It had been the custom in her old school
for girls to have to stand up and talk in class;
and although this was a much more formidable
affair, she was not so much embarrassed as
she would have been but for her training in the
past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Speaking in a rather low tone, she began at
the beginning. In many places she quoted the
professor’s own words. Once she left out a
little string of facts, and went back over her
ground, marshalling them into the proper
place, and then went steadily on up to the very
point where the professor stopped so suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silence in the lecture hall was such as
could be felt; some of the girls, indeed, were
sitting open-mouthed with amazement at such
a feat of memory. But there was a ghost of a
smile hovering about the lips of Miss Groome—she
was thinking how the professor would have
to apologize to the new girl for having so
misjudged her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Professor Plimsoll was fiery in temper,
he was also a very just man. The girls must
have known he had been angry, even though
Dorothy did not seem to have realized it, and
it was due to himself, and to them, that he
should make what amends he could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Dorothy Sedgewick,” he began, and
he bowed to her as impressively as he might
have done to royalty, “I have to beg your
pardon for having entirely misunderstood you.
When I saw that you took no notes I was angry
at what I thought was your laziness, and new
girl though you were, I determined to make an
example of you, and that was why I called you
forward in this fashion. I do apologize most
sincerely for my blunder, and I am charmed
to think that I shall have a student so able
and painstaking at my lectures this term.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great embarrassment seized upon Dorothy
now. She turned scarlet right up to the roots
of her hair as she bowed, murmuring something
inaudible, and then she escaped to her seat
amidst a storm of cheering from the excited girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Plimsoll held up his hand for
silence. The lecture went on to its end, but it
is doubtful whether Dorothy got much benefit
from the latter part. The girls all around
her were showing their sympathy each after
her kind, but she was angry with herself
because she had lacked the penetration to see
that she had really been an object of pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the lecture was over, and they all
streamed out of hall carrying their notebooks,
they fell upon her, cheering her again, and
patting her on the back with resounding thumps
just by way of showing friendliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dorothy, you were great!” cried
Hazel, struggling through the crowd to reach
her. “It was priceless to see you standing
there beside my lord, giving him back his old
lecture on creepy-crawlies as calmly as if you
had been brought up to that kind of thing from
infancy. His eyes gogged and gogged until
I thought they would have come right out of
their sockets! And then to see the way he
climbed down and grovelled at your feet, oh,
it was rich!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dorothy, how did you remember it all?”
cried Margaret, thrusting several girls aside and
coming eagerly close up to Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know; I cannot always remember
things so well,” she answered. “But it was
all so interesting, and the professor has such
a way of ticking his facts off, it is so easy to
keep them in mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is one comfort,” said Hazel. “You
will be certain to be in the Sixth after the little
affair of this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know about that,” replied Dorothy,
thinking of some of the questions on the paper
she had filled in that morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later there came to her a message
summoning her to the Head’s private room,
and she went in fear and trembling. If she
was put in the Sixth, she would be able to enter
for the Lamb Bursary; if she was not in the
Sixth her chance would be gone for always,
for she knew that it was quite impossible for
her to stay at school for more than one year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Arden was very kind; she made Dorothy
sit down, and drawing out the Sixth Form
examination paper, began to talk to her about
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In many ways,” began the Head, speaking
in her calmly assured manner, “I do not think
you are up to the level of the Sixth, but in other
things you are very good indeed. I was still
debating whether to put you straight into the
Sixth, or to keep you for one term in the Upper
Fifth to see how you would shape; but before
I had really made up my mind, Professor
Plimsoll came in and told me of what happened
at his lecture. He was so impressed with your
ability that, acting on his suggestion, I am
going to put you straight into the Sixth, and
I hope that you will work hard enough to
justify me in having done this. It is very
unusual for a new girl to be put into the Sixth.
Different schools have different methods of
work, and a girl has usually to be with us
a little time before we feel sufficiently sure of
her. However, I hope it is all going to be
quite right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you very much; I will be sure to
work,” murmured Dorothy, and her eyes were
shining like two stars at the prospect before
her; then she asked in a low tone, her voice
a little shaken, “May I enter for the Lamb
Bursary, now that I am going to be in the
Sixth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Arden smiled. “You can enter if you
wish. Indeed, I shall be very glad if you do.
Even if you are not within seeing distance of
getting it, the discipline and the hard work
will be good for you. It will be good for the
others too, for the more candidates the better
the work that is done. Rhoda Fleming was
to have left last term, but she has come back
for the purpose of competing. I hope that
next week, when the candidates are enrolled,
a good number of the Sixth will offer themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy went out from the presence of the
Head, feeling as if she was walking on air.
How wonderful that she was in the Sixth!
How still more wonderful that it was really
her humiliation at Professor Plimsoll’s lecture
which was the means of putting her there.
It had not seemed a very awful thing to stand
up beside the professor and repeat to him
what she remembered of his lecture, but it
had been a very keen humiliation indeed to
find that he had considered her a time-waster,
and had really called her out to shame her
in the eyes of the others. She had suffered
tortures while the girls were cheering her.
Yet if all that had not happened, she would not
have been in the Sixth now, with the possibility
of winning the Lamb Bursary in front of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda Fleming was coming down the stairs
as she went up. Just when passing, Rhoda
leaned towards her, and smiling maliciously,
murmured, “Prig!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy’s temper flared. It was an outrage
that this girl who was a thief should call her
names. She jerked her head round to hurl
a scathing remark after the retreating figure,
then suddenly checked herself. True pride
of place was to hold one’s self above the sting
of insults that were petty. After all it did
not matter who called her prig, provided she
was not that odious thing.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap04'>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<h3>TOM IS DISAPPOINTING</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of the week passed in a whirl of
getting used to things and of settling into
place. Dorothy had to find that however good
she might be at memory work, she did not
shine in very many things which were regarded
as essentials at the Compton Schools. She
was a very duffer in all matters connected with
the gym. She was downright scared at many
things which even the little girls did not shirk.
She could not swing by her hands from the bar,
she looked upon punching as a shocking waste
of strength, and even drill had no charm for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mordaunt, the games-mistress, was
not disposed to be very patient with her.
Miss Mordaunt was not to be beaten in her
encouragement of little girls and weakly girls;
she would work away at them until they became
both fearless and happy in the gym. But
a girl in the Sixth ought to be able to take
a creditable place in sports, according to her
ideas. She was really angry with Dorothy
for her clumsiness and her ignorance, which
she chose to call downright cowardice and
laziness. She was not even appeased by being
told that for the last five years Dorothy had
walked two miles to school every day, and the
same distance home again. In consideration
of this daily four miles she had been excused
from all gym work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One is never too old to learn, and you do
not have to walk four miles every day now,”
Miss Mordaunt spoke crisply. She tossed her
head, and her bobbed hair fluffed up in the
sunshine. She was the very best looking of all
the staff, and realizing the unconscious influence
of good looks, she made the most of her attractive
appearance, because of the power it gave
her with the girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know I am rotten at this sort of
thing,” Dorothy admitted with an air of great
humility, as she stood watching little Muriel
Adams somersaulting in a way that looked
simply terrifying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mordaunt suddenly softened. She
had little patience with ignorance, and none
at all with indolence, but a girl who humbly
admitted she was nothing, and less than nothing,
had at least a chance of improvement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you are willing to work hard, to start
at the beginning, and do what the little girls
do, I shall be able to make something of you
in time.” The air of the games-mistress was
distinctly kindly now; she even went out of her
way to pay Dorothy a compliment which all
the rest of the girls could hear. “The amount
of walking you have had to do has had the
effect of giving you a free, erect carriage, and
you have an alert, springy step that is a joy to
behold. I shall have long and regular walks
as part of our course this term, just for the sake
of improving the girls in this respect; the
manner in which some of them slouch along
is awful to behold.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you had kept quiet about your long
walks to school,” grumbled Daisy Goatby
on Friday afternoon, when the long crocodile
of the Compton Girls’ School swung along
through Sowergate, and, mounting the hill to
the Ilkestone promenade, went a long mile
across the scorched grass of the lawns on the
top of the cliffs, and then turned back inland,
to reach the deep little valley of the Sowerbrook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? Don’t you like walking?” asked
Dorothy, who had been revelling in the sea
and the sky, and all the unexpectedness of
Ilkestone generally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I loathe it!” Daisy said with almost
vicious energy. She was so fat that the exercise
made her hot and uncomfortable; she had
a blowsed appearance, and was rather cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is because you are so fat,” Dorothy
laughed, her eyes shining with merriment.
“Why don’t you put in half an hour every
morning punching in the gym, then do those
bar exercises that Hazel and Rhoda were doing
yesterday? You would soon find walking
easier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I take no end of exercise,” grumbled
Daisy. “What with tennis, and hockey, and
bowls, and swimming, one is on all the time.
My fat is not the result of self-indulgence; it is
disease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And chocolates,” laughed Dorothy, who
had seen the way in which her companion had
been stuffing with sweets ever since they had
started out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am obliged to take a little of something to
keep my strength up,” Daisy said in a plaintive
tone; then she burst out with quite disconcerting
suddenness, “What makes Rhoda
Fleming have such a grouch against you, seeing
that you were strangers until the other day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy felt her colour rise in spite of herself,
but she only said quietly, “You had better
ask her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you, I did that directly I found out
how she did not love you,” answered Daisy,
breathing hard—they were mounting a rise
now, and the pace tried her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, and what did she say?” asked
Dorothy, whose heart was beating in a very
lumpy fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She said that you were the most untruthful
person she had ever met, and it was not
safe to believe a word you said,” blurted out
Daisy, with a sidelong look at Dorothy just to
see how she would take it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy flushed, and her eyes were angry,
but she answered in a serene tone, “If I said
I was not untruthful, it would not help much;
it would only be my word against Rhoda’s.
The only thing to do is to let the matter rest;
time will show whether she is right or wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to sit down under it like
that?” cried Daisy, aghast. “Why, it will
look as if she was right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can I do but sit down under it?”
asked Dorothy with an impatient ring in her
tone. “If I were a boy I might fight her,
of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talking of fighting,” burst out Daisy
eagerly, “Blanche Felmore, who is in the Lower
Fifth, told me this morning that your brother
Tom has had a scrap with her brother Bobby,
and Bobby is so badly knocked out that he has
been moved to the san. There is a bit of news
for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am sorry!” exclaimed Dorothy,
looking acutely distressed. “I hate for Tom to
get into such scraps, and it is horrid to think
of him hurting some one so badly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, as to that, if he had not hurt Bobby,
he would have been pretty considerably bashed
up himself,” replied Daisy calmly. “Bobby
Felmore is ever so much bigger than your
brother—he is in the Sixth, and captain of the
football team, a regular big lump of a boy,
and downright beefy as to muscle and all that.
The wonder to me is that Tom was able to
lick him; it must have been that he had more
science than Bobby, and in a fight like that,
science counts for more than mere weight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What made them fight?” asked Dorothy, a
shiver going the length of her spine. It seemed
to her little short of disastrous that Tom
should get into trouble thus early in the term.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy gave a delighted giggle, and her tone
was downright sentimental when she went on
to explain. “Tom is most fearfully crushed
on Rhoda Fleming; did you know it? We
used to make no end of fun of them last term.
Tom is such a kid, and Rhoda is nearly two
years older than he is; all the same he was
really soft about her. They usually danced
together on social evenings, they shared cakes
and sweets and all that sort of thing, and they
were so all-round silly that we got no end of
fun out of the affair. Of course we thought
it was all off when Rhoda was leaving; but
now that she has come back for another year
it appears to have started again stronger than
ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how can it have started?” asked
Dorothy in surprise. “We only came on
Tuesday—this is Friday; we have not met any
of the boys yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy sniggered. “You haven’t, perhaps, but
Rhoda has, and Blanche too. It seems that
the evening before last, Blanche, who had no
money for tuck, ran down into the shrubbery
beyond the green courts to see if the boys were
at cricket; she meant to signal Bobby, and ask
him to send her some money through his
matron, don’t you see. Rhoda saw the kid
loping off, and wanting some amusement,
thought she would go along too. Bobby saw
the signalling, and knowing it was Blanche,
came to see what she wanted. It seems that
Tom also saw a handkerchief fluttering from
the end of the shrubbery, and thinking it was
Rhoda waving to him, came sprinting along
after. He caught Bobby up, too, and passed
him. Rhoda was at the fence, and so they had
a talk, while Blanche told Bobby about having
no money, and got him to promise that he
would send five shillings by his matron that
same evening. Things were pleasant enough
until the girls were coming away; they expected
the bell to go in a minute, and knew that
they would have to scoot for all they were
worth. Then Tom said something about thinking
that Bobby was coming across to see Rhoda,
and he was just jolly well not going to put up
with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, what then?” said Dorothy sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not pleasant to her to find out how
little she really knew about the inside of Tom’s
mind. He was a year younger than herself;
she regarded him as very much of a boy, and
it was rather hateful to think that he was making
a stupid of himself with a girl like Rhoda
Fleming. Poor old Tom!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby Felmore said something rude,”
replied Daisy. “The Felmores are rather
big in their way, and their pride is a by-word.
Bobby remarked that he would not trouble
to go the length of a cricket pitch at the call
of a girl like Rhoda. Tom went for him then
and spat in his face, or something equally
unpleasant. After that it had to be a fight,
of course, and they planned it for yesterday.
When the boys’ matron brought Blanche the
five shillings she told her that Bobby was
licked, and in bed in the san.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will Tom be very badly punished?” asked
Dorothy with dilating eyes; her lively fancy was
painting a picture of dire penalties which might
result, and she was thinking how distressed her
father and mother would be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy laughed merrily. “When you see
Bobby Felmore you will understand what a
most astonishing thing it is that Tom should
have whacked him. Oh no, Tom won’t get
many beans over that. He may have an impot,
of course; but he would get that for any breaking
of rules. I should think that unofficially
the masters would pat him on the back for his
courage. He must be a well-plucked one to
have stood up to Bobby, and to beat him. I
wish I had been there to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t; and I think it is just horrid for
boys to fight!” cried Dorothy, and was badly
ashamed of the tears that smarted under her
eyelids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are young yet; you will be wiser as
you get older,” commented Daisy sagely; and
at that moment the crocodile turned in at the
lodge gates, and the talk was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy had furious matter for thought.
She had been looking forward to Sunday because
she knew that she would have a chance
to talk to Tom for an hour then; and she had
meant to tell him that the girl who did the
shoplifting at Messrs. Sharman and Song’s
place was at the Compton Schools in her form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Tom was so fond of Rhoda Fleming as to
be willing to fight on her behalf, he would not
be very ready to believe what his sister had to
tell him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He might even want to fight me,” Dorothy
whispered to herself, with a rather pathetic
little smile hovering round her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went into the house feeling low-spirited
and miserable; but there was so much to
claim her attention, she had so many things
to think about, and next day’s work to get
ready for, that her courage bounced up, her
cheerfulness returned, and she was as lively
as the rest of them. After all, Tom would have
to fight his own way through life, and it was
of no use to make herself miserable because he
had proved disappointing so early in the term.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap05'>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<h3>TOM MAKES EXCUSE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The girls of the Compton Schools attended
the church of St. Matthew-on-the-Hill,
which stood on the high ground above the
Sowerbrook valley. A grey, weather-worn
structure it was, the tower of which had been
used as a lighthouse in the days of long ago.
It was a small place, too, and for that reason
the boys always went to the camp church, a
spacious but very ugly building, which crowned
the hill just above their school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To both girls and boys it was a distinct
grievance that they were compelled to go to
different churches; but St. Matthew-on-the-Hill
was too small to contain them all, and the
military authorities looked askance at the girls,
so what could not be cured had to be endured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one good thing which resulted from this
was that brothers and sisters were always
together for a couple of hours on Sunday afternoons.
If the weather was fine they went for
walks together; if it was wet they were in
the drawing-room or the conservatories of the
girls’ school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That first Sunday, Dorothy was waiting for
Tom. She was out on the broad gravel path
which stretched along in front of the conservatory,
for the girls had told her that the
boys always came in by the little bridge over
the brook at the end of the grounds, and she
did not want to lose a minute of the time she
could have with her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had imagined he would be in a tearing
hurry to reach her, and she felt downright flat,
after waiting for nearly half an hour, to see
him strolling up the lawn at the slowest of
walks, in company with a lumpy-looking boy
whose face was liberally adorned with strips
of sticking-plaster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Dorothy, are you all on your own?”
demanded Tom, looking distinctly bored; then
he jerked his thumb in the direction of his
companion, saying in a casual fashion, “Here
is Bobby Felmore, the chap I licked the other
day. Did you hear about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I heard,” she answered, and then
hesitated, not quite sure what to say. It would
be a bit embarrassing, and not quite kind, to
congratulate Tom on his victory, with the
beaten one standing close by, so it seemed
safest to say nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a bit rotten to be licked by a kid
like Tom, don’t you think, Miss Sedgewick?”
asked Bobby with a grin. “The fact was, he
is such a little chap that I was afraid to take
him seriously, and that was how he got his
chance at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear him!” cried Tom with ringing scorn.
“But he is ignorant yet; when he is a bit
older and wiser he will understand that a
lump of pudding hasn’t any sort of chance
against muscle guided by science. Besides,
he had to be walloped in the cause of chivalry
and right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You young ass!” exploded Bobby, and
he looked so threatening that Dorothy butted
in, fearing they would start mauling each other
there and then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it is just horrid to fight,” she said
crisply. “It is a low-down and brutish habit.
Are you going to walk, Tom, or shall we sit
in the conservatory and talk? It is nearly
three o’clock, so we have not very much
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not particular,” said Tom with a
yawn. “Where are all the others? If we go
for a walk we have just got to mooch along on
our own; but if we stay in the grounds or the
conservatory we can be with the others, don’t
you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as you please.” Dorothy could not
help her tone being a trifle sharp. It was a
real disappointment to her that Tom did not
want to have her alone for a little while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then, let us go down to that
bench by the sundial. Rhoda Fleming is
there, and the Fletchers; we had a look in at
them, and a bit of a pow-wow as we came up.”
Tom turned eagerly back as he spoke, and
Dorothy walked in silence by his side, while
Bobby Felmore went on into the house in
search of Blanche, who had a cold, and was
keeping to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So that was why Tom was nearly half an
hour late in arriving! Dorothy was piqued
and resentful; but having her share of common
sense, she did not start ragging him—indeed,
she was so quiet, and withal pensive, that Tom’s
conscience began to bother him, and he even
started to make excuse for himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Rhoda and I are great friends—downright
pals, so to speak—and, of course, if
we went for a walk she would not be able to
come too.” He was apologetic in manner as
well as speech, and he slipped his arm round
her waist with a great demonstration of affection
as they went slowly across the lawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was because he was so dear and loving in
his manner that Dorothy suddenly forgot to
be discreet, and was only concerned to warn
him of the kind of girl she knew Rhoda to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom, dear old boy, I wish you would
not be pals with Rhoda,” she burst out impulsively.
“I don’t think you know what sort
of girl she is, and, anyhow, she——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy came to a sudden halt in her hurried
little speech as Tom faced round upon her
with fury in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better stop talking rot of that
kind.” There was an actual snarl in his tone,
and his eyes were red with anger. “Girls are
always unfair to each other, but I thought you
were above a meanness of that sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy’s temper flared—what a silly kid he
was to be so wrapped up in a girl. She fairly
snapped at him in her irritation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you were not so young, so unutterably
green, you would be willing to listen to reason,
and to hear the truth. Since you won’t, then
you must take the consequences, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be in a wax, old girl.” He gave
her an affectionate squeeze as he spoke, which
had the effect of entirely disarming her anger
against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not in a wax; oh, I was, but it has
gone now.” She smiled up into his face as she
spoke, deciding that come what might she could
not risk losing his love by trying to point out
to him what sort of a girl Rhoda was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The September afternoon was very sunny
and warm, and the group of girls on the broad
wooden bench by the sundial were lazily enjoying
the brightness and the heat as Dorothy
and Tom came slowly along the path between
the flower-beds at the lower end of the lawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda Fleming was there, Joan and Delia
Fletcher, and Grace Boldrey, a Fourth Form
kid who was Delia’s chum. They all made
room for Dorothy and Tom, as if they had
expected them to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy found herself sitting between the
two Fletchers, while Rhoda monopolized Tom,
and the Sunday afternoon time, which she
had looked forward to as being like a bit of
home, resolved itself into an ordeal of more or
less patiently bearing the quips and thrusts
of Rhoda, who appeared to take a malicious
pleasure in making her as uncomfortable as
possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The affair of Professor Plimsoll’s lecture was
dragged out and talked about from the point
of view of Rhoda, who, perching herself on
the lower step of the sundial, pretended she
was Dorothy, standing up beside the professor,
and repeating to him his own lecture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda had a real gift of mimicry: the others
rocked with laughter, and Dorothy, although
she smarted under the lash of Rhoda’s tongue,
joined in the laugh against herself, because it
seemed the least embarrassing thing to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt very sore a little later when Tom,
in the momentary absence of Rhoda, said to
her, “It was silly of you to make such an
exhibition of yourself at the lecture. No one
cares for a prig. I should have thought you
would have found that out long ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could not help myself—I had to do as I
was told; and, at least, I owe my place in the
Sixth to having been able to remember.”
Dorothy was keeping her temper under control
now, although of choice she would have reached
up and slapped Tom in the face for daring to
take such a critical and dictatorial tone with
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom shrugged his shoulders. “Every one
to his taste, of course; myself, I would rather
have waited until I was fit for the Sixth, than
have got there by a fluke. You will find it
precious hard work to keep your end up. For
my own part, I would rather have been in the
Upper Fifth until I was able to take my remove
with credit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Tom, if I had been put into the
Upper Fifth I should have stood no chance of
the Mutton Bone,” cried Dorothy in a shocked
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom smiled in a superior and really aggravating
fashion. “Going in for that, are you?
Well, your folly be on your own head; you are
more fond of the wooden spoon than I should
be. For myself, I never attempt anything I’m
not likely to achieve. You don’t catch yours
truly laying himself open to ridicule; but
every one to his taste. Seeing that Rhoda
has come back to school for another year, it
goes without saying that she will win the
Mutton Bone. She is no end clever, and you
won’t have much chance against her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to have a try, anyhow,” said
Dorothy in a dogged tone; and at that moment
Rhoda and Joan Fletcher came back, and the
chances of any homey talk between brother and
sister were over for that afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda and Tom started arguing about a
certain horse that was to run at Ilkestone the
following week, and Dorothy, sitting listening
to Joan Fletcher’s thin voice prosing on about
the merits of knife pleated frocks, wondered
what her father would have said if he could
have heard Tom discussing the points of racehorses
as if he had served an apprenticeship in
a training stable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on, when she walked with him to the
little gate at the end of the grounds, where the
bridge went over the brook and the field path
which led to the boys’ school, Tom began to
make excuses for himself for the depth of his
knowledge on racing matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fellow has to keep his eyes open, and to
remember what he hears, or he would get left
at every turn, you know,” he said, and again he
slid his arm about his sister’s waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think father and mother would
approve of your keeping your eyes so wide
open about horse-racing and that sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy spoke in a rather troubled fashion.
It was really difficult for her to lecture Tom
for his good when he had his arm round her
in that taking fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, naturally the governor and mums
are more than a trifle stodgy in their outlook.
It is a sign of advancing years.” He laughed
light-heartedly as he spoke, then plunged into
talk about football plans and his own chances
of getting a good position in his team.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They lingered at the bridge until the other
boys who had been visiting at the girls’ school
came pouring along the path at a run. Then
the first bell sounded for tea, and Dorothy had
to scuttle back through the grounds at racing
speed, for she would only have five minutes
in which to put herself tidy for tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you have a pleasant afternoon?”
asked Hazel, who had been out with Margaret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was good to be with Tom for a time,”
Dorothy answered, hesitated, and then went
on in a hurried fashion, “It would have been
nicer, of course, if we had been alone together,
or with you and Margaret, but Tom elected to
spend the time with Rhoda and Joan Fletcher,
and—and, well, it was not all honey and roses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t think what the silly boy can see in
Rhoda,” said Hazel severely. “I never cared
much for her myself, and the way in which she
has snubbed Margaret is insufferable. I am
thankful that Dora Selwyn is head girl, and
not Rhoda; it would be awful if she set the
pace for the whole school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dora Selwyn looks nice, but she is rather
unapproachable,” said Dorothy in a rather
dubious tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hazel laughed. “Don’t you know the secret
of that?” she asked. “Dora is about the
shyest girl alive, and her stand-offishness is
nothing in the world but sheer funk. You try
making friends with her, and you will be fairly
amazed at the result.”</p>

<h3>RHODA’S JUMPER</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The first social evening of term was always
something of an event. The Lower Fifth,
the Upper Fifth, and the Sixth of both schools
joined forces for a real merry-making. The
juniors had their own functions, and made
merry on a different evening, and they had
nothing to do with the gathering of the seniors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lecture hall was cleared for dancing;
there were games and music in the drawing-room
for those who preferred them, and supper
for all was spread in the dining-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a soaking wet day; the girls,
in mackintoshes, high boots, and rubber hats,
had struggled for a mile along the storm-swept
sea front. They had been blown back again,
arriving in tousled, rosy-cheeked, and breathless,
but thoroughly refreshed by the blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dressing-bell went five minutes after
they reached the house, and there was a rush
upstairs to get changed, and ready for the
frolic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was very much excited. She was
going to wear the new little frock which she
had bought at Sharman and Song’s place. She
danced up the stairs and along the corridor
to the dorm, feeling that life was very well
worth living indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hazel and Margaret were just ahead of her,
and the other girls were crowding up behind.
They had been rather late getting in from their
walk, and so there was not very much time
before the boys might be expected to arrive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With fingers that actually trembled Dorothy
opened the wrapping paper, and taking out
her frock, slipped it on. The looking-glass in
her cubicle was not very big; she would have
to wait until she went downstairs to have a
really good look at herself. But oh! the lovely
feeling of it all!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Admiring herself—or, rather, her frock—had
taken time. Most of the girls were downstairs
before she was ready. They were standing
about the drawing-room in little groups as
she came in through the big double doors,
feeling stupidly shy and self-conscious, just
because she happened to be wearing a new
frock that was the last word in effective
simplicity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one took any notice of her. The little
group just inside the door had gathered about
Rhoda Fleming, who was spreading out her
arms to show the beauty of the jumper she
was wearing over a cream silk skirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it a dream?” Rhoda’s voice was
loud and clear; it was vibrant, too, with
satisfaction. “I bought it at Sharman and
Song’s; they are not to be beaten for things
of this sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy stood as if transfixed, and at that
moment the crowd of girls about Rhoda shifted
and opened out, showing plainly Dorothy
standing on the outskirts of the group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda paused suddenly, and there was a
look of actual fear in her eyes as she stood
confronting Dorothy. Then she rallied her
forces, and said with a slow, insolent drawl,
“Well, what do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I don’t want anything,” faltered Dorothy,
whose breath was fairly taken away by the
calm manner in which Rhoda was exhibiting the
jumper, which was a lovely thing made of white
silky stuff, and embroidered with silver tissue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then don’t stand staring like that.” There
was a positive snarl in Rhoda’s tone, and Dorothy
turned away without a word. She heard
one of the girls cry out that it was a shame of
Rhoda to be so rude, but there was more fear
than resentment in her heart at the treatment she
had received. It was awful to see the malice in
Rhoda’s gaze, and to know that it was directed
against herself, just because she had been the
unwilling witness of Rhoda’s shoplifting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She would have known the jumper anywhere,
even if Rhoda had not declared so loudly
that it had come from Sharman and Song’s, and
she shivered a little, wondering how she would
have felt if she had been in Rhoda’s place just
then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dorothy, what a pretty frock! How
perfectly sweet you look!” cried the voice
of Hazel at her side, and then Margaret burst
in with admiring comments, and Dorothy
found herself surrounded by a cluster of girls
who were admiring her frock and congratulating
her on having an aunt with such liberal
tendencies. But the keen edge of her pleasure
was taken off by the brooding sense of disaster
that would come to her every time she recalled
the look in Rhoda’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being healthy minded, and being also blessed
with common sense, she set to work to forget
all about the uncomfortable incident, and to
get all the pleasure possible out of the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys arrived in a batch. After the
manner of their kind, they formed into groups
about the big doors of the drawing-room and
at the end of the lecture hall. But the masters
who were with them routed them out with
remorseless energy, and started the dancing.
Bobby Felmore, very red in the face, and still
adorned with sticking-plaster, led out the Head.
He was most fearfully self-conscious for about
a minute and a half. By that time he forgot
all about being shy, for, as he said afterwards,
the Head was a dream to dance with, and she
was a downright jolly sort also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy had danced with big boys, she had
danced with cheeky youngsters of the Lower
Fifth who aired their opinions on various
subjects as if wisdom dwelt with them and
with no one else, and then she found herself
dancing with Bobby Felmore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby, by reason of having danced with the
Head, was disposed to be critical regarding his
partners that evening, and he began telling
Dorothy how he had plunged through a foxtrot
with Daisy Goatby, who was about as
nimble as an elephant, and as graceful as a
hippopotamus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is quite a good sort, though, even if
she is a trifle heavy on her feet,” said Dorothy,
who was hotly championing Daisy just because
Bobby saw fit to run her down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, do you always stick up for people?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When they are nice to me I do, of course,”
she answered with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you won’t have to stick up for
Rhoda Fleming, at that rate,” said Bobby
with a chuckle. “She seems to have a proper
grouch against you. Tom was complaining
as we came along to-night because you and
Rhoda don’t hit it off together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do not have much to do with each
other,” murmured Dorothy, resentful because
Tom should have discussed her with this big
lump of a boy who, however well he might
dance, had certainly no tact worth speaking of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what Tom complained of; said he
couldn’t think why his womenfolk didn’t hit
it off better: seemed to think that you ought to
be pally with any and every one whom he saw
fit to honour with his regard. I like his cheek;
the Grand Sultan isn’t in it with that young
whipper-snapper.” Bobby tossed his head and
let out one of his big laughs then, and Dorothy
thought it might be for his good to take him
down a peg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom is rather small,” she said, smiling
at him with mischief dancing in her eyes;
“but he is a force to be reckoned with, all the
same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you are giving me a dig because of
that mauling I had from him last week,”
chuckled Bobby. “It isn’t kind to kick a
fellow that is down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not kicked you,” she answered;
and her tone was so friendly that Bobby,
rather red, and rather stammering, jerked out,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, I’m really awfully crushed on you,
though I have only seen you about twice.
Say, will you be pals, real pals, you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy turned scarlet, for just at that
moment she caught sight of Rhoda regarding
her fixedly from a little distance. It was
horribly embarrassing and uncomfortable, and
because of it her tone was quite sharp as she
replied, “I have got as many chums already
as I can do with, thank you; but I am really
grateful to you for not being nasty to Tom
over that licking he gave you last week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that!” Bobby’s voice reflected disappointment,
mingled with scorn. “The
licking was a man’s business entirely, and it
need not come into discussion at all. I should
like to be pals with you, and I’m not going to
believe what Rhoda says about you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can Rhoda say about me?” cried
Dorothy, aghast. “Why, I have not known
her a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you, what she doesn’t know she will
make up,” said Bobby, who was by this time
quite breathless with his exertions. “Don’t
you trust her. If she tries to be friendly,
keep her at arm’s length. I have warned Tom
about her until I’m out of breath; but he will
find her out some day, I dare say. Meanwhile
he is not in as much danger of being scratched
by her as you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy did not dance with Bobby again
that evening. Indeed, she did not dance much
after that, for Margaret had a bad headache,
and wandered off to a quiet corner of the
drawing-room, where Dorothy found her, and
stayed to keep her company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just think, to-morrow by this time we shall
be enrolled for the Lamb Bursary, and work
will begin in earnest,” said Margaret, as she
leant back in a deep chair and fanned herself
with a picture paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think work has begun in earnest, anyway,”
Dorothy said with a laugh. “I know
that I just swotted for all I’m worth at maths
this morning. I could not have worked harder
if I had been sitting for an exam. I am
horribly stupid at maths, and I can never find
any short cuts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t put much reliance on short cuts
myself in maths or anything else,” replied
Margaret. “When a thing has to be done,
it is the quickest process in the end to do it
thoroughly, because the next time you have to
travel that way you know the road. By the
way—I hate to speak of it, but you are a new
girl, and you are not so well up in school
traditions as some of the rest of us—did you
use a help this morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A help?” queried Dorothy with a blank
face. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes when a new girl comes she
thinks to catch up in classwork by using cribs—helps
they call them here, because it sounds
rather better. Did you use anything of the
sort this morning?” Margaret looked a little
doubtful and apologetic as she put her question,
but she meant to get at the bottom of the
matter if she could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no, of course I did not.” Dorothy’s
tone was more bewildered than indignant;
she could not imagine what had made Margaret
ask such a question. “Do you think if I had
been using a help, as you call it, that I should
have to work as I do? Besides, do you not remember
how Miss Groome coached me, and the
pains she took, because I was such a duffer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margaret laughed. “You are anything but
a duffer, and you are a perfect whale at work.
Oh! I wish they would not say things about
you. It is so unfair on a new girl. You have
enough to work against in having been put
straight into the Sixth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who have been talking about me, and what
has been said?” asked Dorothy quietly, but
she went rather white. It was horrid to feel
that her good name was being taken away behind
her back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know who started the talk,” said
Margaret with a troubled air. “Kathleen
Goatby was sitting here before you came.
She said you had been dancing a lot with
Bobby Felmore, but she expected he would
have danced by himself rather than have been
seen going round with you if he had known
what was being said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall know better whether to be angry
or merely amused if you tell me what it is that
is being said.” Dorothy’s voice was low, and
her manner was outwardly calm, but there was
a fire in her eyes which let Margaret know
that she was very angry indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kathleen said she heard Rhoda Fleming
telling Joan Fletcher that you always used
cribs, that you owed your position in your old
school to this, and that you said it was the only
way in which you could possibly get your work
done. I told Kathleen she could contradict
that as much as she liked, for I was quite positive
it was not true. Cribs may help up to a certain
point, but they are sure to fail one in the long
run.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never used cribs,” said Dorothy
with emphasis. “What I cannot understand
is why Rhoda should try so hard to do me
harm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think she is afraid of you.” Margaret
spoke slowly, and she turned her head a little
so that her gaze was fixed on the ceiling, instead
of on her companion’s face. “It is possible
she thinks you know something about her that
is not to her credit, and she is fearing you will
talk about it, so she thinks it is wise to be first
at the character-wrecking business. You had
better have as little to do with her as you
decently can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trust me for that; but even avoiding her
does not seem very effectual in stopping her
from spreading slanders,” Dorothy said with
a wry smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fires die out that are not tended,” replied
Margaret with a great air of wisdom. “There
goes the bell. Well, I am not sorry the evening
is over because of my beastly headache. I hope
you have had a nice time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—no,” said Dorothy, and then would
say no more.</p>

<h3>THE ENROLLING OF THE CANDIDATES</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The September sunshine was streaming
in through the big stained-glass windows
of the lecture hall next morning when, at
eleven o’clock, the girls came trooping in from
their Form-rooms, and took their places facing
the dais. The Head was seated there in company
with Mr. Melrose, who acted as governor
of the Lamb Bursary, and two other gentlemen,
who also had something to do with the bequest
which meant so much to the Compton School
for Girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they were all in their places, Mr.
Melrose stood up, and coming to the edge of the
dais, made a little speech to the girls about Miss
Lamb, who had been educated at the Compton
Schools. “Agnes Lamb came to be educated
here because her father, an officer, was at that
time stationed at Beckworth Camp,” he said
in a pleasant, conversational tone, which held
the interest even of those girls who had heard
the story several times before. “She was in
residence for three years, during which time
she made many friendships, and formed close
ties in the school. It was while she was being
educated here that her father died suddenly,
and Miss Lamb, already motherless, was adopted
by an uncle who was very rich, and who at
once removed her from the school. Although
surrounded by every luxury, the poor girl
seemed to have left happiness behind her when
she left the school. Her desire had been for
higher education. Her uncle did not believe
in the higher education of women: all the poor
girl’s efforts after more knowledge were frowned
upon, and set aside. She might have clothes
in prodigal abundance, she might wear a whole
milliner’s shop on her head, and her uncle
would not have complained; but when she
wanted lessons, or even books, she was reminded
that but for his charity she would be
a beggar: and, indeed, I think many beggars
had greater possibilities of happiness. The
years went on. Miss Lamb, always a gentle
soul, lacked the courage and enterprise to
break away from her prison, and continued
to languish under the iron rule of her uncle.
Her youth passed in close attendance on the
crabbed old man, who had become a confirmed
invalid. She had her romance, too: there was
a man who loved her, and she cared for him;
but here again her uncle’s will came between
her and her happiness. The sour old man
reminded her that he had kept her for so many
years—that he had provided her with dainty
food, and clothed her in costly array: now,
when he was old and suffering, it would be
base ingratitude for her to leave him, especially
as the doctors told him he had not long to live.
Because she was so meek and gentle, so
easily cowed, and so good at heart, Miss Lamb
sent her lover away to wait until she should
be free to take her happiness with him. But
the old uncle lingered on for several years.
The man, who was only human, got tired of
waiting, and on the very day when the death
of the old uncle set Miss Lamb free he was
married to a woman for whom he did not
particularly care, just because he had grown
tired of waiting for the happiness that tarried
so long. Miss Lamb never really recovered from
that blow. She lived only a few years longer,
but she filled those years with as much work
for her fellows as it was possible to get
into the time. When she died, and her will
was read, it was found that her thoughts must
have lingered very much on the happy time
she had spent within these walls, for the bulk
of her property came for the enrichment of
the Compton Girls’ School. In addition to
this she left a sum of money which should,
year by year, entitle one girl to the chance of
a higher education.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Melrose was interrupted at this point
by a tremendous outburst of cheering; indeed,
it seemed as if the sixty girls must have throats
lined with tin, from the noise they contrived
to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Melrose did not check them; he merely
stood and waited with a smile on his face,
wondering, as he looked at the wildly cheering
mob, if any one of them would have been as
meek under burdens as had been the gentle
soul whose memory they were so vigorously
honouring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cheering died to silence, and then he
began to speak again. “I have finished the
story of how it was that Miss Lamb came to
leave so much money to the school, and now
I am going to ask Mr. Grimshaw to read the
rules for the enrolment of candidates for the
Lamb Bursary. You will please follow that
reading very carefully, making up your minds
as he proceeds, as to whether you individually
can fulfil the terms of the bequest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Grimshaw was an elderly gentleman of
nervous aspect, with a thin, squeaky voice
which would have upset the risibles of the
whole school at any ordinary time; but the
girls for the most part listened to him with
gravely decorous faces, although one irrepressible
Fourth Form kid rippled into gurgling
laughter, that was instantly changed to a
strangled cough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reading began with a tangle of legal
terms and phrases as to the receiving of the
money, and the way in which it was to be laid
out, and then the document stated the requirements
looked for in the candidate:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Each candidate offering herself for the
winning of the Lamb Bursary must be in
the Sixth Form of the Compton Girls’
School. She must be of respectable parentage,
which is to say, that neither of her
parents shall have been in prison. She herself
must have a high moral character. No
girl known to have cheated, or to have
robbed her fellows in any way, is eligible
as a candidate. It is furthermore required
that each candidate shall take all the general
subjects taught in the school, and no candidate
shall be allowed to specialize on any
particular subject; but each one to be
judged on the all-round character of her
learning. Candidates must be enrolled for
three terms, the judging being on the marks
made in that time. Each girl offering herself
as a candidate will, with right hand
upraised, declare solemnly, that she is a fit
person to be enrolled as a candidate, and
that she individually fulfils the conditions
laid down in this document.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The squeaky voice ceased, and Mr. Grimshaw
with some creaking of immaculate boots
sat down, while a profound hush settled over
the rows of bright-faced girls. A robin just
outside one of the open windows sang blithely,
and away in the distance a bugle sounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a stir in the long row of Sixth
Form girls. Hazel rose to her feet, her face
rather white and set, for she was the first to
enroll, and the situation gripped her strangely;
but her voice rang clearly through the hall as,
with right hand raised, she said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, Hazel Dring, offer myself as a candidate
for the Lamb Bursary. I promise to abide by
the conditions laid down, and I declare myself
a fit person to be enrolled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Melrose looked at the Head, who bowed
slightly, then he said to Hazel, “Will you please
come on to the dais and be enrolled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went forward, and the gentleman who
had not spoken proceeded to spread a paper
before her, which she had to sign. Meanwhile
Margaret stood up, and raising her right
hand, made the affirmation in the same way,
and she was followed by Daisy Goatby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was thrilled to the very centre of
her being. She rose to her feet, she lifted
her right hand, while her voice rang out vibrant
with all sorts of emotions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, Dorothy Sedgewick, offer myself as a
candidate for the Lamb Bursary. I promise
to abide by the conditions laid down, and I
declare myself a fit person to be enrolled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the Head bowed in response to the
inquiring look of Mr. Melrose, who asked
Dorothy to join the others on the dais, and she
went forward, feeling as if she was treading
on air. It seemed such a solemn ceremony,
and there was the same sensation of awe in her
heart that she felt when she was in church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was in the midst of writing her name
when she heard the stir of another girl rising
and then the words:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, Rhoda Fleming, offer myself——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy paused with her pen suspended,
and her face went ashen white, as the glib
tongue of Rhoda repeated the declaration that
she was a fit person to be enrolled. Oh, how
could she do it? Was it possible that Tom
was right, and the average girl had no sense at
all of honour, or moral obligation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you finish your signature, if you
please, Miss Sedgewick.” It was the quiet
voice of the gentleman taking the signatures
that broke in upon Dorothy’s confused senses.
Murmuring an apology, she finished writing
her name, and went across to sit beside Daisy
Goatby, while Rhoda came up to the dais to
sign the enrollment paper. Joan Fletcher was
the next, and she was followed by Jessie Wayne.
Dora Selwyn, the head girl, did not compete;
she was specializing in botany and geology,
and did not want to be compelled to give her
time to other subjects. There were seven
candidates this year: last year there had been
four, and the year before there had been eight.
As Miss Groome, the Form-mistress remarked,
seven was a good workable number, sufficient
to make competition keen, but not too many
to crowd each other in the race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the conclusion of the little ceremony the
girls rose to their feet to sing “Auld Lang Syne,”
and then with a rousing three-times-three—the
first for Miss Lamb of evergreen memory,
the second for the school, and the third for
the newly-enrolled—they swarmed out to the
grounds, for the rest of the day was to be
holiday. They were to have a tennis tournament
among themselves, with a box of chocolates
for first prize, and an ounce of the strongest
peppermints to be bought in Sowergate as
consolation to the one who should score the
least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three gentlemen stayed to lunch, and
sat at the high table in the dining-room with
the Head and such of the staff as were not at
the lower tables carving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The seven candidates had been decorated with
huge white rosettes, in recognition of their
position, and the talk at table was chiefly about
Miss Lamb and her unfortunate love story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect she was afraid if she had married
the man her uncle would have cut her out of
his will, and so she would have been poor,”
said Rhoda, who was very bright and gay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy shivered a little. Rhoda’s voice
made her feel bad just then. It was to her
a most awful thing that a girl who knew herself
guilty of deliberate theft should rise and affirm
with uplifted hand that she was morally fit to
compete for the Lamb Bursary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps she didn’t care over-much for
him,” said Daisy Goatby with a windy sigh.
“Getting married must be an awful fag. She
could look forward to being free when the old
man died; but if she had married, she might
never have been free, don’t you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think she was a martyr, poor dear.”
Dorothy had the same vibrant sound in her
voice as when she rose to affirm, and the other
girls dropped silent to listen to what she had
to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you think she was a martyr?”
asked Margaret softly, seeing that Dorothy
paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because she sacrificed everything to a
principle.” Dorothy flushed a little as she
spoke; she was too new to her surroundings
to feel at ease in making her standpoints clear,
and she was oppressed also by Rhoda’s bravado
in affirming, in spite of that damaging incident
at Sharman and Song’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was no principle involved that I
can see,” grumbled Joan Fletcher with wrinkled
brows. “There was self-sacrifice if you like,
although, to my way of thinking, even that was
uncalled for, seeing that the old man had the
money to pay for any service he might require.
I am not going to grumble at her for putting
aside her happiness, because if I win the
bursary I shall be so much the better off in
consequence of her deciding to sacrifice herself
for her uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think Dorothy is right,” chimed in Hazel
crisply. “Miss Lamb made a principle out
of her duty, real or supposed, to her uncle:
she gave up her chance of married happiness
because her sense of what was right would have
been outraged if she had not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she was a martyr!” exclaimed Jessie
Wayne. “I shall see her as a picture in my
mind next time we sing ‘The martyr first whose
eagle eye.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare say you will, goosey”—Dora Selwyn
leaned forward past Dorothy to speak to Jessie,
who sat at the end of the table—“meanwhile,
you will please get on your feet, for the Head
is rising.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie scrambled up in a great hurry, punting
into Daisy Goatby, who sat on the other side
of her. Daisy, heavy in all her movements,
lurched against a plate standing too near the
edge of the table, and brought it to the ground
with a crash. But the crash was not heard, for
Hazel, who saw it falling, and the gentlemen
rising to leave the room at the same moment,
swung up her hand for a rousing cheer, and in
the burst of acclamation the noise of smashing
was entirely lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a morning it has been!” murmured
Dorothy, as she strolled down to the tennis
court with Margaret for a little practice at the
nets before the serious work of the tournament
should begin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” Margaret spoke emphatically. She
paused, and then said rather shyly, “I should
not have been very happy about it all, though,
if it had not been for the talk I had with you
last night. Oh! I was worried about that
rumour of your depending on helps that are
not right for your work. I think I should
have fainted, when you made your affirmation,
if I had known that there was anything not
right about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not expect you would have swooned,
however badly you might have felt.” Dorothy’s
tone was rather grim as she spoke, for she was
thinking of Rhoda. “It is astonishing what
we can bear when hard things really come upon
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps so. Anyhow, I am very glad it
was all right,” Margaret sighed happily, and
slid her arm in Dorothy’s. “I even had a
big struggle with myself when Rhoda Fleming
stood up to affirm, and I forgave her again
from the bottom of my heart for every snub
she has ever handed out to me, for it seemed
as if it would make her record sweeter if I did
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I were as good as you.” Dorothy’s
tone was a little conscience stricken. There
had been no desire in her heart to have Rhoda
clean enough to affirm; she had been merely
conscious of a great amazement at the girl’s
audacity and callousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rot, I am not good!” jerked out
Margaret brusquely; and then, Sixth Form
girl though she was, she challenged Dorothy
to race to the nets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a neck-and-neck struggle, and the
victor was nearly squashed at the goal by the
vanquished falling on to her, and they helped
each other up, laughing at the figures they must
have cut, and the loss of hard-won dignity
involved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Dorothy who won, but that was only
because she had a longer stride. She knew this
right well, and Margaret knew it too.</p>

<h3>THE TORN BOOK</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The studies at the Compton Girls’ School
were at the top of the house, and consisted
of three small rooms set apart for the use of
the Sixth, and one fair-sized chamber that was
used as prep room by the Upper Fifth. The
private sitting-room of the Form-mistresses
was also on this floor, the rooms all opening
on to one long passage, which had a staircase
at either end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were twelve girls in the Sixth, which
gave four to a study. Hazel and Margaret had
with them Dorothy, and also Jessie Wayne, who
was a very quiet and studious girl, keeping to
her own corner, and having very little to do
with the others. The head girl, Dora Selwyn,
had the middle study with three others, and
the remaining four, of whom Rhoda Fleming
was one, had the third room, which was next
to the prep room of the Upper Fifth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the rooms on this floor were fitted with
gas fires, and were very comfortable. To
Dorothy there was a wonderfully homey feeling
in coming up to this quiet retreat after the
stress and strain of Form work. She shared
the centre table with Hazel, while Margaret
had a corner opposite to the one where Jessie
worked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One Friday evening at the end of October
they were all in the study, and, for a wonder,
they were all talking. The week’s marks had
been posted on the board in the lecture hall
an hour before, and they had read the result
as they came out from prayers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Dorothy’s class position which had
led to the talking; for the first time since she
had come to the school she was fourth from
the top. Dora Selwyn, Hazel, and Margaret
were above her, and Rhoda Fleming was
fifth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rhoda has been fourth so far this term,”
said Jessie Wayne. “She will not take it
kindly that you have climbed above her,
Dorothy. How did you manage to do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t think how I got above her,” answered
Dorothy, who was flushed and happy, strangely
disinclined for work, too, and disposed to lean
back in her chair and discuss her victory.
“Rhoda is a long way ahead of me in most
things, and she is so wonderfully good at maths,
too, while I am a duffer at figures in any shape
or form.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are pulling up though. I noticed
you had fifty more marks for maths than you
had last week,” said Hazel, who had been deep
in a new book on chemistry, which she was
annotating for next week’s class paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know I am fifty up.” Dorothy
laughed happily. “To tell the truth, I have
been swotting to that end. Indeed, I have let
other things slide a bit in order to get level
with the rest of you at maths. I have to work
harder at that than anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you jumped in Latin too; you were
before me there,” said Margaret. “I should
not be surprised if you have me down next
week or the week after. You will have your
work cut out to do it, though, for I mean to
keep in front of you as long as I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t see myself getting in front of you,”
said Dorothy. “You seem to know all there
is to be known about most things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In short, she is the beginning and end of
wisdom,” laughed Hazel. “But we must get
to work, or by this time next week we shall
find ourselves at the bottom of the Form.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a row there is in the next study,”
said Dorothy. “Don’t you wonder that Dora
puts up with such a riot, and she the head
girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The noise is not in the next study,” said
Jessie, who had opened the door and gone out
into the passage to see where the noise came
from. “It is Rhoda and her lot who are carrying
on. They do it most nights, only they do
not usually make as much noise as this. I
suppose they are taking advantage of the mistresses
having gone to Ilkestone for that lecture
on Anthropology; Dora has gone too, so there
is no one up here to keep them in order
to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, shut the door, kid, and drag the
curtain across it to deaden the noise. We have
to get our work done somehow.” There was
a sound of irritation in Hazel’s voice; she had
badly wanted to go to the lecture herself, but
she knew that she dared not take the time. If
she had been free like Dora she would have
gone, and not troubled about the fear of dropping
in her Form; but in view of her position
as an aspirant for the Mutton Bone, she dared
not run the risk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence in the study for the next
hour. Sometimes a girl would get up to reach
a book, or would rustle papers, or scrape her
chair on the floor; but there was no talking,
until presently Jessie pushed her chair back,
and rising to her feet, declared that she was
going to bed, simply because she could not
keep awake any longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am coming too,” said Hazel. “I am
doing no good at all, just because I keep dropping
asleep; I suppose it is because it has been
so windy to-day. Are you others coming
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margaret said that she would go—and indeed
she was so pale and heavy-eyed that she did
not look fit to stay up any longer; but Dorothy
said that she wanted to finish the Latin she
was doing for next day, and would stay until
she had done it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the others had gone she rose and
turned out the gas fire, fearful lest she might
forget it when she went to bed, and there was
a considerable penalty waiting for the girl who
left a gas fire burning when she left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The upper floor had grown strangely still.
The Upper Fifth had gone downstairs to bed
some time ago. There were no mistresses in
their private room, which to-night was not
even lighted. The noise in the third study
had died away, and there was a deep hush over
the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy worked on steadily for a time, then
suddenly she felt herself growing nervous;
there was a sensation upon her that some one
was coming, was creeping along the passage,
and pausing outside the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped work, she held herself rigid,
and stared fixedly at the door. The handle
moved gently—some one was coming in. The
horror of this creeping, silent thing was on
her; she wanted to scream, but she had no
power—she could only pant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door creaked open for perhaps half an
inch. Dorothy sprang up, and in her haste
knocked over a pile of books, which fell with
a clattering bang on the floor. For a moment
she paused, appalled by the noise she had made
in that quiet place; and then, wrenching open
the door, she faced the passage, which stretched,
lighted and empty, to her gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a jerk she clicked off the electric light
of the study, and with a series of bounds
reached the top of the stairs, fleeing down and
along the corridor to the dormitory. All the
girls were in bed except Hazel, who looked out
from her cubicle to know what was wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nerves, I expect. Yah, I turned into a
horrible coward, and when the door creaked
gently open I just got up and fled,” said
Dorothy, who was hanging on to the side of
her cubicle, looking thoroughly scared and done
up from her experience upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you have been doing too much;
you would have been wiser to have come down
when we did,” said Hazel calmly; and then, as
her own toilet was all but complete, she came
and helped Dorothy to get to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was good to be helped. Dorothy was
shaking in every limb, and she was feeling
so thoroughly demoralized that it was all she
could do to keep from bursting into noisy
crying. She thanked Hazel with lips that
trembled, and creeping into her bed, hid her
head beneath the clothes because her teeth
chattered so badly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sleep came to her after a time, for she was
healthily tired with the long day of work and
play. But with sleep came dreams, and these
were for the most part weird and frightening.
Some evil was always coming upon her from
behind, and yet she could never get her head
round to see what it was that was menacing
her. Oh, it was fearful! She struggled to
wake, but was not able; and presently she slid
into deeper slumber, getting more restful as
the hours went by. Then the old trouble
broke out again: something was certainly coming
upon her, the curtains of her cubicle were
shaking, her bed was shaking, and next minute
she herself would be shaken out of bed. Making
a great effort she opened her eyes, and saw
Margaret standing over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter?” gasped Dorothy,
wondering why her head was feeling so queer
and her mouth so parched and dry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what I have come to ask you,”
said Margaret with a laugh. “You have nearly
waked us all up by crying out and groaning in
a really tragic fashion. Are you feeling ill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no, I am all right,” said Dorothy,
who began to feel herself all over to see if she
was really awake and undamaged. “I have
been having ghastly dreams, and I thought
something was coming after me, only I was
not able to get awake to see what it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! a fit of nightmare, I suppose.” Margaret’s
tone was sympathetic, but she yawned
with sleepiness, and shivered from the cold.
“I found you lying across the bed with your
head hanging down, as if you were going to
pitch out on to the floor, so I guess you were
feeling bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the time?” Dorothy had
struggled to a sitting posture, and was wondering
if she dared ask Margaret to creep into bed
with her, for there was a sense of panic on her
still, and she feared—actually feared—to be
left alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the wee sma’ hours are getting bigger.
It is just five o’clock—plenty of time for a good
sleep yet before the rising bell. Lie down,
and I will tuck you in snugly, then you will
feel better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy sank back on her pillow, submitting
to be vigorously tucked in by Margaret.
She was suddenly ashamed of being afraid
to stay alone. Now that she was wider awake
the creeping horror was further behind her,
while the fact that it was already five o’clock
seemed to bring the daylight so much nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was soon asleep again, and she did not
wake until roused by the bell. So heavy had
been her sleep that her movements were slower
than usual, and she was the last girl to leave
the dormitory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To her immense surprise both Hazel and
Margaret gave her the cold shoulder at breakfast.
They only spoke to her when she spoke
to them. They both sat with gloom on their
faces, as if the fog in which the outside world
was wrapped that morning had somehow got
into them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was at first disposed to be resentful.
She supposed their grumpiness must be the
result of her having disturbed the dormitory
with her nightmare. It seemed a trifle rotten
that they should treat her in such a fashion
for what she could not help. She relapsed
into silence herself for the remainder of breakfast,
concentrating her thoughts and energies
on the day’s work, and trying to get all the
satisfaction she could out of the fact that she
had pulled up one again this week in her school
position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dorothy, the Head wishes to see you in
her study as soon as breakfast is over.” There
was a constraint in Miss Groome’s voice
which Dorothy was quick to feel, and she looked
from her to the averted faces of Hazel and
Margaret, wondering what could be the matter
with them all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Miss Groome, I will go,” she said
cheerfully; and she held her head up, feeling
all the comfort of a quiet conscience, although
privately she told herself that they were all
being very horrid to her, seeing that she was
so absolutely unconscious of having given
offence in any way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Head’s study was a small room on the
first floor, having a window which gave a delightful
view over the Sowerbrook valley, with
a distant glimpse of the blue waters of the
English Channel. There was no view to be
had this morning, however—nothing but a grey
wall of fog, dense and smothering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Arden was sitting at her writing table,
and lying before her was a torn book—this was
very shabby, as if from much use. There was
something so sinister about the disreputable
volume lying there that Dorothy felt her eyes
turn to it, as if drawn by a magnet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Dorothy; come and sit
down.” The tone of the Head was so kind that
all at once Dorothy sensed disaster, and the
colour rushed in a flood over her face and right
up to her hair, then receded, leaving her pale
and cold, while a sensation seized upon her
of being caught in a trap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat down on the chair pointed out by
the Head, trying to gather up her forces to
meet what was in front of her, yet feeling
absolutely bewildered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There followed a little pause of silence.
It was almost as if the Head was not feeling
quite sure about how to tackle the situation in
front of her; then she said in a crisp, businesslike
manner, pointing to the torn book in front
of her, “This book, is it yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Dorothy with decision. “I am
sure it is not. I have no book so ragged and
worn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you have borrowed it, then?”
persisted the Head, fixing her with a keen
glance which seemed to look right through
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon?” murmured Dorothy,
looking blank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I asked, have you borrowed it?” repeated
Miss Arden patiently. It was never her way
to harry or confuse a girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never seen it before that I can
remember. What book is it?” Dorothy
fairly hurled her question at the Head, and rose
from her seat as if to take it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Head waved her back. “Sit still, and
think a minute. This book was found with
yours on the table of your study this morning.
I have learned that you were the last girl to
leave the study last night; your books were
left in a confused heap on the table, and this
one was open at the place where you had been
working before you went to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was doing Latin before I went to bed,”
said Dorothy, her senses still in a whirling
confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just so. This book is a key, a translation of
the book we are doing in the Sixth this time,”
said the Head slowly, “Now, do you understand
the significance of it being found among
your books?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that you think I was using
a key last night in preparing my Form Latin?”
asked Dorothy, her eyes wide with amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I only mean that appearances point
to this, and I have sent for you so that you may
be able to explain—to clear yourself, if that is
possible; if not, to own up as to how far you
have been depending on this kind of thing to
help you in your work and advance your
position in your form.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy sat quite silent. Her face was white
and pinched, and there was a feeling of despair
in her heart that she had never known before.
It was her bare word against this clear evidence
of that torn, disreputable old book, and how
could she expect that any one was going to
believe her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, I want to hear what you have to
say about it all.” The voice of the Head had a
ring of calm authority, and Dorothy found her
tongue with an effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never used a key to help me with
my Latin, or with any of my work, and I have
never seen that book before,” she said in a low
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was found among the books you had been
using before you went to bed.” There was so
much suggestion in the voice of the Head that
Dorothy gave a start of painful recollection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I left my books lying anyhow, and I
shall have to take a bad-conduct mark. I am
so sorry, but I was frightened, and ran away.
I ought to have gone to bed when Hazel and
Margaret went down, but I wanted to finish
my Latin; it takes me longer than they to do
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What frightened you?” demanded the
Head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While I was sitting at work, and the place
was very still, I had suddenly the sensation
of some one, or something, creeping along
outside the door; I saw the handle turn, and
the door creaked open for half an inch; I cried
out, but there was no answer, and I just got
up and bolted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was not much to frighten you in
the fact of some one coming along the passage
and softly opening the door?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice of the Head was questioning, and
under the compelling quality of her gaze Dorothy
had to own up to the real cause of her fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The girls have said that the rooms up there
are haunted—that a certain something comes
along at night opening the doors, sighing
heavily, and moaning as if in pain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear sighs and moans?” asked
the Head, her lips giving an involuntary twitch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not stay to listen; I bolted as fast
as I could go,” admitted Dorothy. “That was
why my books were not put away, or any of
my things cleared up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know why the girls say the rooms
are haunted?” asked the Head, and this time
she smiled so kindly that Dorothy found the
courage to reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was told that a girl, Amelia Herschstein,
was killed on that landing.” Her voice was
very low, and her gaze dropped to the carpet.
Standing there in the daylight it seemed so
perfectly absurd to admit that she had been
nearly scared out of her senses on the previous
evening by her remembrance of a ghost story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t seem to have got the details
quite right,” said the Head in a matter-of-fact
tone. “About twenty years ago, I have been
told, the landing where the studies are was
given up to the Sixth for bedrooms; girls were
not supposed to need studies then—at least
they did not have them here. There was no
second staircase then; the place where the
stairs go down by the prep room of the Upper
Fifth was a small box-room which had a window
with a balcony. Amelia Herschstein was
leaning over this balcony one night to talk to a
soldier from Beckworth Camp who had contrived
to scrape an acquaintance with her, when
she fell, and was so injured that she died a week
later. I suppose that the idea of the haunting
comes from the fact of the Governors making
such drastic alterations in that part of the house
immediately afterwards. I am sorry you were
frightened by the story, and I can understand
how you would rush away, forgetting all about
your books. But your fright is a small matter
compared with this business of the torn book.”
As she spoke the Head pointed in distaste at the
ragged, dirty book in front of her, and paused,
looking at Dorothy as if expecting her to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy had nothing to say. Having told
the Head that she had never seen the book
before, it seemed useless to repeat her assertion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a little pause Miss Arden went on:
“Your Form-mistress says that she has always
found you truthful and straightforward in your
work. It is possible that you have an enemy
who put the book among your things. For the
present I suspend judgment. As the matter
is something of a mystery, and others of the
Form may be involved, I must also suspend the
Latin marks of the entire Form to-day. Will you
please tell Miss Groome that I will come to her
room, and talk about this question of the day’s
Latin, at eleven o’clock. You may go now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy bowed and went out, with her head
held very high and her heart feeling very
heavy.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap09'>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<h3>UNDER A CLOUD</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy understood now the reason
why Hazel and Margaret had treated her
to so much cold shoulder that morning. There
was a keen sense of fairness in her make-up,
and while she resented the unfriendly treatment,
in her heart she did not blame them for
the stand they had taken. If they really believed
she did her work by means of such helps
as that torn book represented, then they were
quite within their rights in not wanting to
have anything to do with her. The thing
which hurt her most was that they should have
passed judgment on her without giving her
a chance to say a word in her own defence.
Yet even that was forgivable, seeing how strong
was the circumstantial evidence against her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked into her Form-room, apologizing
to Miss Groome for being late, and she took
her place as if nothing had been wrong. The
only girl who gave her a kind look, or spoke a
friendly word, was Rhoda Fleming, and Dorothy
was ungrateful enough to wish she had kept
quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Work went on as usual. Dorothy had given
the message of the Head to Miss Groome, who
looked rather mystified, and was coldly polite
in her manner to Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never had a morning dragged as that one
did; it took all Dorothy’s powers of concentration
to keep her mind fixed on her work.
She was thinking, ruefully enough, that she
would not have much chance of keeping her
Form position if this sort of thing went on for
long. She blundered in her answers over
things she knew very well, and for the first
time that term work was something of a hardship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eleven o’clock at last! The hour had not
done striking, and the girls were, some of them,
moving about preparing for the next work,
when the door opened, and the Head came in.
She looked graver than usual; that much the
girls noticed as those who were seated rose at
her entrance, and those who were moving to
and fro lined up hastily to bow as she came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Motioning with her hand for them to sit
down again, the Head took the chair vacated
for her by Miss Groome, and sitting down began
to talk to them, not as if they were schoolgirls
merely, but as woman to woman, telling
them of her difficulty, and appealing to their
sense of honour to help her out of her present
perplexity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very concerned for the honour of
the school,” she said, and there was a thrill
of feeling in her voice which found an echo
in the hearts of the listeners. “This morning
the prefect on duty for the study floor found
a pile of books lying partly on the table and
partly on the floor in No. 1 study. Lying open
on the table, partly under the other books, was
a torn and dirty Latin key. The books were
the property of Dorothy Sedgewick, who had
been the last to leave the study overnight.
The matter was reported to Miss Groome,
who brought the book to me; and I, as you
know, sent for Dorothy to come to me directly
after breakfast. Dorothy says she has never
used a key, and that she had never seen that
ragged old book. She declares that it was not
among her books overnight. When being
frightened by some one stealthily trying to enter
her room, she rose from her seat, and staying
only to turn off the electric light, bolted for
the dorm, and went to bed. Miss Groome
says she has always found Dorothy straight in
her work and truthful in her speech. This
being so, we are bound to believe her statement
when she says she has never seen that book,
and that she has never used a key. But as
books do not walk about on their own feet,
we have to discover who put that book among
Dorothy’s things. Can any of you give me
any information on the mystery, or tell me
anything which might lead to it being cleared
up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was dead silence among the girls. In
fact, the hush was so deep that they could hear
a violin wailing in the distant music-room, a
chamber supposed to be sound-proof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the pause had lasted quite a long time,
Hazel asked if she might speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am waiting for some of you to begin,”
replied the Head, smiling at Hazel, though in
truth her heart beat a little faster. Hazel had
always been a pupil to be proud of, and it was
unthinkable that she should be mixed up in
a thing of this sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was no book ragged and dirty among
Dorothy’s things when we went to bed. There
could not have been a book of that sort in the
room during the evening, for we had all been
turning our books out and tidying them in
readiness to start the fresh week of work. It
was not more than twenty minutes after we
had come down to bed that Dorothy came
rushing down to the dorm, looking white and
frightened. She was shaking so badly that
she could hardly stand. I helped her to bed;
but I don’t think she slept well, as she had
nightmare, and woke most of us with her
groaning and crying—she had plainly had a
very bad scare. I have had a lot to do with her
since the term began, and I have never known
her say anything that was not true; she does
not even exaggerate, as some girls do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brow of the Head cleared, her heart
registered only normal beats, and she said with
a smile, “I am very glad for what you have
said, Hazel. Schoolgirls have a way of sticking
together in a passive way, keeping silent
when they know that one is in the wrong, and
that sort of thing; but it is wholly refreshing,
and a trifle unusual in my experience, for them
to bear testimony to each other’s uprightness
as you have done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy’s head drooped now. It was one
thing to hold it high in conscious innocence,
when she was the suspected of all, but it broke
down her self-control to hear Hazel testifying
to her truthfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margaret, who was sitting at the next desk,
turned suddenly and gripped Dorothy’s hand
across the narrow dividing space, and Dorothy
suddenly felt it was worth while to be in trouble,
to find that she had the friendship of these two
girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has any other girl anything to say?” asked
the Head sweetly, and she looked from one to
the other, as if she would read the very thoughts
that were passing through their heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps they would come to you quietly?”
suggested Miss Groome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be pleased to see them if they prefer
that way.” The Head was smiling and serene,
but there was a hint of steel under the velvet
of her manner; and then in a few quiet words
she delivered her ultimatum. “Pending the
making plain of this mystery of how the torn
book came to be among Dorothy Sedgewick’s
things, the whole Form must be somewhat under
a cloud. That is like life, you know; we all
have to suffer for the wrong-doing of each
other. If in the past Dorothy had been proved
untruthful in speech and not straight in her
dealings, then we might have well let the
punishment fall upon her alone. As it is, you
will all do your Latin for the week without any
marks. You will do your very best, too, for the
girl producing poor work in this direction will
immediately put herself into the position of a
suspected person. If the statement of Dorothy,
supported by the testimony of Hazel, is to be believed,
that the book was not in the study overnight,
then it must have been put there out of
malice, and it is up to you to find out who has
done this thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Head rose as she finished speaking, and
the girls rose too, remaining on their feet until
she had passed out of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great was the grumbling at the disaster which
had fallen upon the Form. Individual cases
of cheating at work had occurred from time
to time, but nothing of this kind had cropped
up within the memory of the oldest inhabitant—not
in the Sixth Form, that is to say. It was
supposed that by the time a girl had reached
the Sixth she had sown all her wild oats, and
had become both outwardly and in very truth
a reliable member of society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this case there was malice as well as cheating.
The girl who owned the key had not
merely used it to get a better place in her form,
but she had tried to bring an innocent person
into trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an agitated, explosive feeling in
the atmosphere of the Form-room that morning.
But, thanks to the hint from the Head
concerning the character of work that would be
expected of them, Miss Groome had no cause
for complaint against any of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Jessie Wayne sagely remarked, the real
test concerning who was the owner of the torn
book would come during the week, when the
girl had to do her work without the help of
her key; most likely the task for to-day had
all been prepared before the book was slid
in among Dorothy’s things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a good half of the girls who
believed that Dorothy had been using the key
when she was scared by the ghost who haunted
that upper floor. They did not dare put their
belief into words, but they let it show in their
actions, and Dorothy had to suffer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her great consolation was the way in which
Hazel and Margaret championed her. They
had certainly given her the cold shoulder that
first morning, but since she had asserted her
innocence so strongly, they had not swerved in
their loyalty. Jessie Wayne also declared she
was positive Dorothy had never used the key,
because of the trouble she took over her Latin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The talk of the upper floor being haunted
reached the ears of Miss Groome, making her
very angry; but she went very pale too, for,
with all her learning and her qualifications, she
was very primitive at the bottom, and she had
confessed to being thoroughly scared when the
Head had a talk with her that day after Form
work was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Head had asked if Miss Groome suspected
any of her girls in the matter of cribbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not,” replied the Form-mistress.
“Dorothy Sedgewick has, of course, the hardest
work to keep up with her Form, but she is
doing it by means of steady plodding. She
is not brilliant, but she is not to be beaten at
steady work, and it is that which counts for
most in the long run.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Head nodded thoughtfully, then she
asked in a rather strange tone, “Did you
wonder why I did not bring that tattered book
into the Form-room when I came to talk
about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I did,” replied Miss Groome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not dare bring it because of the
commotion which might have sprung up.”
The Head laughed softly as she spoke, and unlocking
an inner drawer of her desk, she produced
the torn old book which had made so
much discomfort among the Sixth. “Look at
this.” As she spoke she put the dirty old thing
into the hands of Miss Groome, pointing to
a name written in faded ink on the inside of
the cover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name was Amelia Herschstein, and
when she had read it Miss Groome asked with
a little gasp, “Why! what does it mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is just what I want to find out,”
replied the Head crisply. “It looks as if we
are up against a full-sized mystery.”</p>

<div><h1 id='chap10'>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<h3>FAIR FIGHTING</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The weeks flew by. There had been no
clue to the mystery of that torn book which
had Amelia Herschstein’s name written inside
the cover, and in the rush of other things the
matter had been nearly forgotten by most of
the girls. The Head and Miss Groome did
not forget; but whereas Miss Groome frankly
admitted herself scared stiff by the uncanny
character of the find, and refused to be left
alone in the sitting-room on the upper floor
when the others had gone to bed, the Head
got into the habit of walking quietly up the
stairs most nights, going along the passage,
opening the doors of the different rooms, and
coming down the other stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She meant to get to the bottom of the mystery
somehow, but so far she had not found much
reward for her searching. When the governors
had arrived on their monthly visit to the schools,
and had come to lunch with the girls, she had
invited the unsuspecting gentlemen into her
private room, and had led the talk to the days
of the past, and then had put a few searching
questions about the tragedy of Amelia Herschstein,
asking who she was, and how it came
about that such an accident occurred. To her
surprise she found they resented her questioning,
and her attempts to get information drew
a blank every time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she took her courage in her hands, and
faced the three gentlemen squarely. “The
fact is,” she said, speaking in a low tone, “I
am up against a situation which fairly baffles
me. If you had been willing to talk to me
about this affair of the tragic fate of the poor
girl, I might not have troubled you with my
worries, or at least not until I had settled them.
I have found that Amelia is said to walk in
the upper passage where the studies are. This
has the one good effect of making the Sixth
Form girls very ready to go to bed at night.
But I find that the mistresses do not take
so much pleasure as formerly in their private
sitting-room, which is, as you know, also on
that passage. Then a week or two ago a girl,
alone in a study up there, was frightened by
the sensation of something coming; she saw
the handle of the door turn, and the door come
gently open for a little way. I am sorry to say
she did not stay to see what would happen
next, but bolted downstairs to the dorm as
fast as she could go. The strange part of the
affair was that there was found among that
girl’s books next morning a torn old book,
a key to the Latin just then being studied
by the Form, and the name inside the book,
written in faded ink across the inside of the
cover, was Amelia Herschstein.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” The exclamation came from
the most formal looking of the governors, and
taking out his handkerchief he hurriedly mopped
his face as if he was very warm indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You understand now why I am anxious
to know all there is to be known about the
tragedy.” The Head looked from one to the
other of the three gentlemen as she spoke, and
she noted that they seemed very much upset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a case which landed the school in
heavy trouble,” said the formal man, after a
glance at the other two as if asking their consent
to speak. “It was proved pretty clearly from
things which came out at the inquest, and what
the soldier afterwards admitted, that it was not
because she had fallen in love with him that
Amelia arranged meetings and talks with this
soldier. She was trying to get from him details
of a government invention on which he had
been working before he came to Beckworth
Camp. Now, a love affair of that sort was bad
enough for the reputation of the school, but
can you not see how infinitely worse a thing
of this kind will prove?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed I can.” The Head was frankly
sympathetic now, and she was taking back
some of the hard thoughts she had cherished
against the unoffending governors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was proved, too, that the father of Amelia
had been in the German Secret Service,” went
on the formal man. “Consideration for the
feelings of the bereaved parents stopped the
authorities from taking further proceedings.
The soldier, a promising young fellow, and
badly smitten by the young lady who was
trying to make a tool of him, was sent to India
at his own request, and was killed in a border
skirmish a few months later. You understand
now how it is we do not care even among
ourselves to talk of the affair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do understand,” the Head replied. “But
what you have told me does not throw any light
on the mystery of how that book came to be
with Dorothy Sedgewick’s things in the No. 1
study.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It only points to the probability of some
of Amelia’s kin being in the school, and if that
is found to be the case they will have to go,
and at once.” The formal man shut his mouth
with a snap as if it were a rat trap, and the
Head nodded in complete understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they would certainly have to go,”
she said, and then she deftly turned the talk
into other channels; and being a wise, as well
as a very clever woman, she saw to it that the
cloud was chased from their faces before they
went away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now she knew where she stood, and it was
with a feeling of acute relief that she set herself
to the business of finding out the source from
which that torn book came. The first thing to
do was to have a talk with Miss Groome. Her
lip curled scornfully as she recalled the terror
displayed by the Form-mistress. Of what good
was higher education for women if it left them
a prey to superstitious fears such as might have
oppressed poor women who had no education
at all?</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A big hockey match was engrossing the
attention of every one during the last week in
November. It was big in the sense of being
very important, for they were to play against
the girls of the Ilkestone High School, and
the prestige of the school with regard to hockey
would hang on the issue of the game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the only game Dorothy played at all
well; she was good at centring, and she was
not to be beaten for speed. The games-mistress
wanted her for outside right, and Dora Selwyn,
who was captain, agreed to this. But she exacted
such an amount of practice from poor
Dorothy in the days that came before the one
that was fixed for the match that other work
had to suffer, and she had to face the prospect
of her school position going down still lower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never once since that affair of finding the
torn book among her things had Dorothy been
able to reach the fourth place in her Form.
The next week she had been fifth again, with
Rhoda once more above her, and the week
after that she had suffered most fearfully at
finding Joan Fletcher also above her. All this
was so unaccountable to her because she knew
that she was working just as hard as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes she was inclined to think she
was being downed by circumstances. She was
like a person being sucked down in a quagmire—the
more she struggled the lower down she went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course this was silly, and she told herself
that despair never led anywhere but to failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her keenest trouble was that she knew herself
to be, by some people, a suspected person—that
is to say, there were some who said that
she must have used cribs in the past, which
accounted for her failures now that she might
be afraid to use them. There was this good
in the trouble, that it made her set her teeth
and strive just so that she might show them
how false their suppositions were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reason her position had dropped was
largely due to the fact that the other girls had
worked so much harder. The words of the
Head concerning the position of slackers had
fallen on fruitful ground. No girl wanted to be
looked upon as having used cribs to help her
along. The others, all of them, had the advantage
of being used to the work and routine of
the Compton School. Dorothy, as new girl, was
bound to feel the disadvantages of her position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda Fleming had a vast capacity for work,
and she had also a heavy streak of laziness in
her make-up. Just now she was working for
all she was worth, and the week before the
hockey match she rose above Margaret, who
seemed to shrink several sizes smaller in consequence.
She had to bear a lot of snubbing,
too, for so elated with victory was Rhoda,
that she seemed quite unable to resist the
temptation of sitting on Margaret whenever
opportunity occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It pleased Rhoda to be quite kind, even
friendly, to Dorothy, who did not approve the
change, and was not disposed to profit by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days before the hockey match Rhoda,
encountering Dorothy who was lacing her
hockey boots, offered to help with her work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t bear to see you slipping back week
by week,” she said with patronizing kindness.
“Of course you are new to things. There is
that paper on chemistry that we have to do
for to-morrow’s lab work—can I help you
with that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy stared at her in surprise, but was
prompt in reply. “No, thank you; I would
rather do my work myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet you use cribs,” said Rhoda with an
ugly smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy felt as if a cold hand had gripped
her. “I do not!” she said quietly, forcing
herself to keep calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda laughed, and there was a very unpleasant
sound in her mirth. “Well, you don’t
seem able to prove that you don’t, so what is
the good of your virtuous pose? If your position
drops again this week, don’t say I did not
try to help you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The incident caused Dorothy to think furiously.
She was sure that Rhoda had, somehow,
a hand in her position dropping. Was
it possible that she was boosting Joan Fletcher
along in order to lower Dorothy, and so make
it appear that there could not be smoke without
a fire in the matter of that old book?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She broke into a sudden chuckle of laughter
as she sat on the low form in the boot-room
lacing up her second boot. Rhoda had departed,
and she believed herself alone. Then
along came Margaret, wanting to know what
the joke was; and leaning back with her head
against the wall and her boot laces in her hand,
Dorothy told her of Rhoda’s kind offer, and
the threat which followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah! it is a fight, is it?” cried Margaret.
“Well, let them rise above us week by week
if they want to. But, mind you, Dorothy, we
have got to keep our end up somehow. Hazel
and I have been going through the marks—dissecting
them, you know—and we find that
both you and I have made our steady average
week by week; we have not fallen back—it is
the others who have pulled up. Hazel says she
is pretty sure that Rhoda will pull above her
next week. There is one comfort—it is awfully
good for Miss Groome; and I am sure the poor
thing looks as if she needs a little something to
cheer her up, for she does seem so uncommonly
miserable this term—all the fun is clean knocked
out of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we could work harder,” grumbled
Dorothy. “Oh, this hockey match is a nuisance!
Just think what a lot of time it wastes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you believe it, old thing,” said
Margaret. “It is hockey, and the gym, and
things of that sort that make it possible for
us to swot at other things. It makes me mad
to hear the piffle folks talk about the time at
school that is wasted on games. If the people
who talk such rot had ever worked at books as
we have to work they would very soon change
their tune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I know all that.” Dorothy’s tone was
more than a trifle impatient, for she was feeling
quite fed-up with things. “My complaint is
that hockey makes me so tired; I am not fit
for anything but to go to sleep afterwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just so. And isn’t that good for you?”
Margaret wagged her head with an air of great
understanding. “Before I came here—when
I was working for the scholarship—I should
as soon have thought of standing on my head
in the street as wasting my precious time
on games. The result was that I was always
having bad headaches, and breaking down over
my work; and I used to feel so wretched, too,
that life seemed hardly worth living. Indeed,
I wonder that I ever pulled through to win the
scholarship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the same, this match is an awful nuisance,”
grumbled Dorothy; and then she was
suddenly ashamed of her ill-temper and her
general tendency to grouch.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap11'>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<h3>DOROTHY SCORES</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Dora Selwyn was a downright good
captain. What she lacked in brilliance
she made up in painstaking. She was always
after individual members of her team when
they were playing for practice, and she lectured
them with the judgment and authority of an
expert. A lot of her spare time was taken up
in studying hockey as played by the great ones
of the game. She had even gone so far as to
write letters of respectful admiration to the
players of most note; and these invariably
replied, giving her the hints for which she had
asked with such disarming tact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The match with the first team of the Ilkestone
High School meant a lot to her. That team had
an uncommonly good opinion of themselves,
and, doubtless, they would not have stooped
to challenge the senior team of the Compton
Girls’ School but for the fact that they had
just been rather badly beaten by a team of
Old Girls, and were anxious to give some team
a good drubbing by way of restoring their self-confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day of the match came, bringing with
it very good weather conditions. If Dora felt
jumpy as to results, she had the sense to keep
her nervousness to herself, and fussed round
her team with as much clucking anxiety as a
hen that is let out with a brood of irresponsible
chickens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The match was to be played at Ilkestone.
She would have been much happier if the
fight had been on their own ground; but the
arrangement had been made, and it had to
stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was nervous too, but she would
not show it. This was the first time she had
played in an outside match with the team, and
she was very anxious to give a good account of
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her position had been changed at the last
minute—that is to say, at yesterday’s practice.
Rhoda had persuaded Dora to give her the
outside right, which left Dorothy the position
of outside left, which, as every one knows, is
the most difficult position of the hockey field.
Naturally, too, she smarted at being thrust into
the harder task when she had made such efforts
to train for her place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, there is no appeal against the command
of the captain, and Dorothy climbed into the
motor charabanc that was taking them to
Ilkestone, seating herself next to Jessie Wayne,
and smiling as if she had not a care in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My word, you do look brisk, Dorothy,
and as happy as if you were going to your own
wedding,” said Daisy Goatby in a grudging
tone, as the charabanc with its load of girls
and several mistresses slid out of the school
gates and, mounting the steep hill past the
church, sped swiftly towards Ilkestone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t I look happy?” asked
Dorothy. “Time enough to sit and wail
when we have been beaten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t even mention the word, Dorothy,”
said the captain sharply; and she looked so
nervy and uncomfortable that Dorothy felt
sorry enough for her to forgive her for the
changed position. She was even meek when
Dora went on in a voice that jerked more than
ever: “I do hope you will do your best,
Dorothy. I am horribly upset at having to
change your position, but Rhoda declared she
would not even try if I left her as outside left.
So what was I to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she going to try now?” asked Dorothy
rather grimly. She was wondering what would
have happened if she had done such a thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she says she will, and one can only
hope for the best; but I shall be downright
glad when it is all over, and we are on our
way back.” Dora shivered, looking so anxious
that Dorothy had to do her level best at cheering
her, saying briskly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect we shall all go back shouting ourselves
hoarse, and we shall have to hold you
down by sheer force to keep you from making
a spectacle of yourself. Oh, we are going to
win, don’t you worry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I did not care so much,” sighed Dora.
Then she turned to give a word of counsel to
another of the team, and did not lean over to
Dorothy again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ilkestone team were on the ground
waiting, while the rest of the High School
were drawn up in close ranks to be ready to
cheer their comrades on to victory. Dorothy’s
heart sank a little at that sight. She knew
full well the help that shouting gives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Hazel rushed up to her. “Dorothy,
your brother Tom has just come; he says the
boys of the Fifth and Sixth are on their way
here to shout for us. Oh! here they come.
What a lark it is, for sure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a lark it was. The boys came streaming
across the stile that led into the playing-field
from the Canterbury road; and although they
were pretty well winded from sprinting across
the fields to reach the ground in time, they let
out a preliminary cheer as an earnest of what they
were going to do later on, when play had begun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The High School girls, not to be beaten, set
up a ringing cheer for their side. Their voices
were so shrill that the sound must have carried
for a long way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Play was pretty equal for the first quarter,
then the High School team got a bit involved
by the fault of the forwards falling back when
the other side passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time and again, when the backs cleared with
long hits to the wings, their skill was wasted,
for the wingers were not there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Dorothy’s spirits went up like a
rocket. She knew very well that once falling
back of the forwards had begun it was certain
to go on. For herself, she was doing her bit,
and a very difficult bit it was, and there seemed
no glory in it; but wherever she was wanted,
there she was, and it was the outburst of shouting
which came from the boys that told her
the side was keeping their end up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The play was fast and furious while it lasted,
and the shouting on both sides was so continuous
that it seemed to be one long yell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly, for Dorothy at least, the end
came. She was in her place, when the ball
came spinning to her from a slam hard shot.
She swung her stick, and caught it just right,
when there was a crashing blow on her head
which fairly knocked her out. She tumbled in
a heap on the grass, and that was the last she
remembered of the struggle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she came to her senses again she was
lying on the table in the pavilion, and a doctor
was bending over her, while the anxious faces
of Miss Groome and the games-mistress showed
in the background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, whatever has happened?” she asked,
staring about her in a bewildered fashion.
“Did I come a cropper on the field?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose that is about what you did
do,” replied the doctor, speaking with slow
deliberation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is funny!” Dorothy wrinkled her forehead
in an effort to remember. “I thought I
hit my head against something—a most fearful
crack it seemed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” The doctor gently lifted her head
as he made the exclamation; he slid off her hat,
and passed his fingers gently through her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! it hurts!” she cried out sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he saw that the back of her hat was cut
through, and there was a wound on her head.
He called for various things, and those standing
round flew to fetch them. He and Dorothy
were momentarily alone, and he jerked out a
sudden question: “Who was it that fetched
you that blow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy looked her surprise. “I am sure
I don’t know,” she said doubtfully; “there
was no one quite close to me. I remember
swinging my stick up and catching the ball just
right, and then I felt the blow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some one fouled you, I suppose—a stupid
thing to do, especially as yours was such a good
shot.” He was very busy with her head as
he spoke, but she twisted it out of his hands so
that she could look into his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it a good shot?” she asked excitedly.
“Did we win the game?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without doubt you would have won if it
had been fought to a finish,” he said kindly.
“Now, just keep still while I attend to this
dent in your head, or you will be having a
fearful headache later on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy did have a headache later on. In
fact, it was so bad that she was taken back
to Sowergate in the doctor’s motor, instead of
riding in the charabanc with the others. She
felt so confused and stupid that it seemed ever
so good to her to lie back in the car and to
have nothing to think about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She protested vigorously, though, when the
school was reached and she was taken off to the
san, to be made an invalid of for the rest of the
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really can’t afford the time,” she said,
looking at the doctor in an imploring fashion.
“My Form position has been going down week
by week of late, and this will make things still
worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it,” he said with a laugh.
“You will work all the better for the little
rest. Just forget all about lessons and everything
else that is a worry. Read a story book
if you like—or, better still, do nothing at all.
If you are all right to-morrow you can go to
work again; but it will depend upon the way
in which you rest to-day whether you are fit
to go to work to-morrow, so take care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy had to submit with the best grace
she could, and the doctor handed her over to
the care of the matron, with instructions that
she was to be coddled until the next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had been watching the game—that was
why I happened to be on the spot,” he said
to the matron as he turned away. “I don’t
think I ever heard so much yelling at a hockey
match before. I’m afraid I did some of it
myself, for the play was really very good. I
did not see how the accident happened, though;
but I suppose one of the players in lunging
for the ball just caught this young lady’s head
instead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy elected to go straight to bed. If
her getting back to work to-morrow depended
on the manner in which she kept quiet to-day,
then certainly she was going to be as quiet
as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile great was the commotion among
the hockey team. All the riotous satisfaction
the Compton Schools would have felt at the
victory which seemed so certain was dashed
and spoiled by the accident which had happened
just when Dorothy had made her
splendid shot. “Who did it?” was the cry
all round the field. But there was no response
to this; and although there were so many
looking on, no one seemed to be able to pick
out the girls who were nearest to Dorothy,
and there was no one who admitted having hit
her by fluke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The High School team said and did all the
correct things, and then they suggested that
the game should be called a draw. Naturally
the Compton Schools did not like this; but, as
Dora Selwyn said, a game was never lost until
it was won, so the High School team had right
on their side, and after a little talking on both
sides it was settled to call it a draw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even this raised the Compton team to a
higher level in hockey circles; henceforth no
one would be able to flout them as inefficient,
and the High School would have to treat them
with greater respect in the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We should not have done so well if the
boys had not come to shout for us,” Dora
admitted, when that night she had dropped
into the study where Hazel and Margaret were
sitting alone, for Jessie Wayne had hurt her
ankle in getting out of the charabanc, and was
resting downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noise is a help sometimes,” admitted
Hazel, who wondered not a little why the head
girl had come to talk to them that night, instead
of leaving them free to work in peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not have to wonder long. After a
moment of hesitation Dora burst out, “Why
does Rhoda Fleming hate Dorothy Sedgewick
so badly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mutual antagonism perhaps,” replied Hazel
coolly. “Dorothy does not seem particularly
drawn to Rhoda, so they may have decided to
agree in not liking each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be flippant; I am out for facts, not
fancies,” said the head girl sharply. She paused
as if in doubt; then making up her mind in a
hurry, she broke into impetuous speech. “I
have found out that it was Rhoda who struck
Dorothy down on the hockey field. But I am
not supposed to know, and it is bothering me
no end. I simply don’t know what I ought
to do in the matter, so I have come to talk it
over with you, because you are friends—Dorothy’s
friends, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you find it out? Are you quite
sure it is true?” gasped Hazel. “It is a
frightfully serious thing, really. Why, a blow
like that might have been fatal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what makes me feel so bad about
it,” said Dora. “I had a bath after we came
back from the match, and I went to my cubicle
and lay down for half-an-hour’s rest before
tea. No one knew I was there except Miss
Groome; she understood that I was feeling
a bit knocked out with all the happenings, so
she told me to go and get a little rest. I think
I was beginning to doze when I heard two
girls, Daisy Goatby and Joan Fletcher, come
into the dorm, and they both came into Daisy’s
cubicle, which is next to mine. They were
talking in low tones, and they seemed very
indignant about something; and I was going
to call out and tell them not to talk secrets,
because I was there, when I heard Daisy say
in a very stormy tone that in future Rhoda
Fleming might do her own dirty work, for she
had entirely washed her hands of the whole
business, and she did not intend to dance to
Rhoda’s piping any more—no, not if next week
found her at the bottom of the Form. Then
Joan, in a very troubled fashion, asked if Daisy
were quite sure—quite absolutely positive—that
Rhoda aimed at Dorothy’s head instead of
at the ball. Daisy sobbed for a minute in sheer
rage, it seemed to me, and then she declared it
was Dorothy’s head that was aimed at. There
was some more talking that I could not hear,
then some of the other girls came up, Joan
went off to her own cubicle, and that was the
end of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious, what a shocking business!”
cried Hazel, going rather white, while Margaret
shivered until her teeth chattered. “Dora,
what are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can I do?” cried the head girl,
throwing up her hands with a helpless gesture.
“Suppose I went to the Head and made a
statement, and she called upon Daisy to own
up to what she knew, it is more than likely that
Daisy would vow she never said anything of the
sort. She would declare she did not see Rhoda
strike Dorothy, and in all she said Joan would
back her up. It would be two against one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daisy would speak the truth if she were
pushed into a corner,” put in Margaret, who
had not spoken before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She might, and again she might not.”
Dora’s tone was scornful. “For all her size,
Daisy is very much of a coward. Her position,
too, would be so unpleasant that really it would
take a good lot of real courage to face it. All
the girls would point at her for telling tales,
and Rhoda would pose as a martyr, and get
all the sympathy she desired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do, then?” asked
Hazel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see that anything can be done,
except to wait and to keep our eyes open,”
said Dora. “I wish you could find out what
it is that Dorothy has over Rhoda—that might
help us a little. It will be rather fun when this
week’s marks come out if Daisy does go flop in
her Form position.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dorothy will have scored then, even though
her work may be hindered,” said Margaret.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap12'>CHAPTER XII</h1></div>

<h3>DOROTHY IS APPROACHED</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy rested with such thoroughness,
that when the doctor came to see her next
day he told her with a laugh that she was a
fraud so far as being an invalid was concerned,
and that she could go to work again as soon as
she liked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her head was fearfully sore, of course, and
if she moved quickly she had a queer, dizzy
sensation, but otherwise she did not seem much
the worse, and she was back in her Form-room
before the work of the morning had ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one was very nice to her. There
was almost an affectionate ring in Rhoda’s
tone when making inquiry as to how she felt,
and Dorothy was a little ashamed of her own
private feeling against Rhoda. Then Daisy
Goatby giggled in a silly fashion, and Rhoda’s
face turned purply-red with anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Work went all the more easily because of
the rest she had had, and Dorothy thought the
doctor must be something of a wizard to
understand so completely what was really best
for her. There was more zest in doing to-day,
and the hours went so fast that evening came
even more quickly than usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie Wayne’s foot was still bad, and she
had not come up to the study. The other
girls had taken her books down to her, and she
was given a quiet corner in the prep room of
the Lower Fifth; so the three girls were alone
upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being alone, the chance to find out Dorothy’s
position with regard to Rhoda was much too
good to be passed by, and sitting at ease in a
low chair by the gas fire, Hazel started on her
task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy listened in silence, and in very
real dismay, while they told her what Dora had
overheard; but she sat quite still when they
had done, making no attempt at clearing the
matter up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you say something, Dorothy?”
Hazel’s tone was a trifle sharp, for there was
an almost guilty look on Dorothy’s face, as if
she were the culprit, and not Rhoda at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing I can say.” Dorothy
wriggled uneasily in her chair, and her hands
moved her books in a restless fashion, for she
wanted to plunge into work and forget all
about the disagreeable thing which always
lurked in her mind with regard to Rhoda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do admit you know something which
makes Rhoda afraid of you?” persisted Hazel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she need not be afraid of me; I shall
not do her any harm.” Dorothy spoke hurriedly.
She was afraid of being drawn into
some admission which might give away her
knowledge of what Rhoda had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you ought to tell, Dorothy,” Hazel
said. “It is all very well to keep silent because
you don’t like to do Rhoda any harm; but when
a girl sets out to work such mischief as Rhoda
tried to do yesterday, it is quite time something
is done to stop her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t call it real proof that Rhoda
did give me that knock-out blow yesterday,”
said Dorothy slowly. “Or even supposing
that she did, you can’t be certain it was anything
but an accident. When one is excited—really
wrought up, as we all were—there is
not much accounting for what happens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, she might have owned up.” Hazel
meant to have the last word on the subject,
and Dorothy made a wry face—then laughed
in a rather forced manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would not have been an easy thing to
have owned up if it had been an accident;
while, if the blow had been meant to knock me
over, it would have been impossible to have
explained it. In any case, she would think that
the least said the soonest mended.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about her coaching Daisy and Joan,
so that your Form position should be lowered?”
Hazel’s brows were drawn together in a heavy
frown; she left off lounging, and sat erect in
her chair looking at Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather a brainy idea, don’t you think?”
Dorothy seemed disposed to be flippant, but
she was nervous still, as was shown by her
restless opening and shutting of her books.
“When I want to get you and Margaret lowered
in your Form position I will prod a couple of
girls into working really hard, and then we
shall all three mount in triumph over your
diminished heads. Oh, it will be a great
piece of strategy—only I don’t quite see how I
am going to get the time to do my work, and
that of the other girls too. That is the weak
point in the affair, and will need thinking out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Dorothy, you are just playing
with us, and it is a shocking waste of time,
because we have got our work to do before we
go to bed.” Margaret slid a friendly hand
into Dorothy’s as she spoke. “Will you tell
us what you know about Rhoda? You see,
she is a candidate for the Mutton Bone; she
is climbing high in the Form, and it is up to
us to see that the prize goes only to some one
worthy of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is because she is a candidate that my
tongue should be tied,” answered Dorothy.
“When Rhoda asserted that there was nothing
to prevent her from being enrolled she took
all the responsibility for herself into her own
hands, and so I have nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will keep silent, and let her win the
Lamb Bursary?” cried Hazel in a shocked tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t let her win the Lamb Bursary if I
can help it. I jolly well want to win it myself,”
laughed Dorothy; and then she simply refused
to say any more, declaring that she must get
on with her work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence in the study after that—a
quiet so profound that some one, coming and
opening the door suddenly, fled away again
with a little cry of surprise at finding it lighted
and occupied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy turned as white as paper. She was
thinking of the night when she had been up
there alone, and had been so scared at the opening
of the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, who is playing pranks in such a silly
fashion, I wonder?” said Hazel crossly, and
jumping up, she went into the passage to find
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dora Selwyn had two girls in with her; they
declared that they had heard nothing—but as
they were all talking at once when Hazel went
into the room, this was not wonderful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the next study Rhoda Fleming was busily
writing at the table, while Daisy dozed in a
chair on one side of the gas fire, and Joan
appeared to be fast asleep on the other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These also declared that they had heard
nothing; and as the room of the Upper Fifth
was empty, and there was no one in the private
room of the mistresses, the affair was a bit of a
mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hazel had sharp eyes; she had noticed that
Rhoda’s hand was trembling, and that her
writing was not clear and decided. She had
seen Daisy wink at Joan, and she came to certain
conclusions in her own mind—only, as she
had no proof, it seemed better to wait and say
nothing. So she went back to the study to tell
Margaret and Dorothy that evidently some one
had come to play a silly prank on them, only
had been scared to find that they were all
wide awake and at work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy stayed awake a good long time that
night, thinking matters over, and trying to
find out what was the wisest course to take.
She was disposed to go to Rhoda and tell her
what she had heard, and to say that there was
no need for Rhoda to fear her, as there was no
danger of her speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When morning came this did not look so
easy, and yet it seemed the best thing to do.
The trouble was to get the chance of a few
quiet words with Rhoda, and the whole day
passed without such a thing being possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was two days later before her chance
came. But when she tried to start on something
which would lead up to the thing she
wanted to say, Rhoda swung round with an
impatient air, speaking sharply, “You and I
do not care so much for each other that we
need to hang round in corners gossiping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is something I wanted to say to
you rather badly,” said Dorothy, laying fast
hold of her courage, and looking straight at
the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda flinched. “Well, whatever it is, I
don’t want to hear it—so there you are.” She
yawned widely, then asked, with a sudden
change of tone, if Dorothy’s head was better,
or if it was still sore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is getting better, thank you.” Dorothy
spoke cheerfully, and then she burst out
hurriedly, “I wanted to say to you that there
is no need for you to be afraid of me, or—or
of what I may say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” demanded Rhoda,
with such offence in her tone that Dorothy
flushed and floundered hopelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I mean just what I say—merely that,
and nothing more.” Dorothy looked straight at
Rhoda, who flushed, while a look of fear came
into her eyes, and she turned away without
another word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that, things were more strained than
before. There was a thinly veiled insolence
in Rhoda’s way of treating Dorothy which was
fearfully trying to bear. But if they had to
come in contact with each other when people
were present, then there was a kind of gentle
pity in Rhoda’s way of behaving which was
more exasperating still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy carried her head very high, and she
kept her face serene and smiling, but sometimes
the strain of it all was about as much as she
could stand up under.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing helped her to be patient under
it all. Her Form position was mounting again.
Daisy Goatby and Joan Fletcher had dropped
below her, and by the last week of term she
had risen above Rhoda again. Great was the
jubilation in the No. 1 study on the night when
this was discovered. Hazel and Margaret made
a ridiculous paper cap, with which they adorned
Dorothy, and Jessie Wayne presented her with
a huge paper rosette in honour of the event.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I foresee that you will have us down next
term, Dorothy, and then, instead of celebrating,
we shall sit in sackcloth and ashes, grousing
over our hard lot in being beaten,” laughed
Hazel, as she settled the paper hat rakishly
askew on Dorothy’s head, and fell back a step
to admire the effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There won’t be much danger of that unless
we get to work,” answered Dorothy, and then
they settled down to steady grind, which lasted
until bedtime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning there was a letter from Tom
for Dorothy, which bothered her not a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twice already that term Tom had come to
her for money. They each had the same
amount of pocket-money, but he did not seem
able to make his last. He was always in a state
of destitution; he was very often in debt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letter this morning stated that if she
could not let him have five shillings that day
he would be disgraced, the family would be
disgraced, and the doors of a prison might
yawn to let him in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was silly, of course, and she frowned
at his indulging in nonsense at such a time.
She had the five shillings, and she could let
him have it; but it seemed to her grossly
unfair that he should spend his own money
and hers too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys were coming over that evening,
and Tom asked that he might have the money
then. Dorothy decided that the time had come
for her to put her foot down firmly on this
question of always standing prepared to help
him out when he was stoney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That afternoon they were busy in the gym
practising a new set of exercises, and Dorothy
was endeavouring to hang by one hand from
the cross-bar, while she swung gently to and
fro with her right foot held in her left hand—she
was succeeding quite well too, and was
feeling rather proud of herself—when a chance
remark from Blanche Felmore caught her ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boys are having a fine run of luck this
term,” said Blanche, as she poised lightly on
the top of the bar to which Dorothy was clinging.
“Bob sent me ten shillings yesterday as
a present; he says he has won a pot of money
this week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did he do it?” asked a girl standing
near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They get up sweepstakes among themselves,
and they get a lot of fun out of it too,”
said Blanche. “Bob told me that half of the
boys are nearly cleaned out this week, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then Dorothy’s hold gave way, and she
fell in a heap, hearing no more, as Blanche fell
too.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap13'>CHAPTER XIII</h1></div>

<h3>WHY TOM WAS HARD UP</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy had come to nearly hate that
pretty evening frock of hers, because it
seemed to her the buying of it had been at the
root of most of her troubles since she had been
at the Compton School. She argued to herself
that if she had not been on the spot when Rhoda
stuffed the jumper under her coat, most of the
unpleasant things could not have happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of choice Dorothy would not have worn
the frock again that term, but when one has
only a single evening frock, that frock has to
be worn whenever the occasion demands it.
The rules of the school were that each girl
should have one evening frock, and only one,
so it was a case of Hobson’s choice. Dorothy
slipped the frock over her shoulders on the
evening when the boys were coming over, and
felt as if she would much rather go up to the
study, and grind away at books until bedtime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a state of mind being a bit unnatural,
she gave herself a shake, which served the
double purpose of settling her frock and her
mind at the same time; then she went downstairs,
and cracked so many jokes with the
other girls, that they all wondered what had
come to her, for she was usually rather quiet,
and not given to over-much in the way of fun-making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the boys came trooping in Bobby
Felmore made straight for her—he mostly did.
Dorothy received him graciously enough, but
there was a sparkle in her eyes which should
have shown him that she was out to set things
straight according to her own ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many dances are you going to let
me have to-night?” he asked, bending closer
to her and looking downright sentimental.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy laughed softly, and her eyes sparkled
more than ever as she murmured in a gentle
tone, “This one, and never another, unless——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless what?” he demanded blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blanche says you have been winning a lot
of money in a sweepstake of some sort in your
school during the last week or so. Is it true?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet it is true,” he answered with a
jolly laugh. “I just about cleaned out the lot
of them, and I’m in funds for the rest of the
term, with a nice little margin over to help me
through the Christmas vac.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you are a horrid, mean thing to take
my money, that I had saved by going without
things,” she said, with such a burst of indignation,
that Bobby looked fairly knocked out
by her energy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There were none of the girls in this sweepstake—at
least I did not know of any,” he said
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not; and if there had been, I should
not have been one of them,” she answered
coldly. “It would not have been so bad if
I had put down the money—I should have felt
that at least I had spent it myself, and I had
chosen to risk losing it. As it is, I have to go
without the things I want, just to fill your
pocket—and I don’t like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t see what you are driving at yet,”
he said, and he looked blanker than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are teaching Tom to gamble,” she
said coldly, “and Tom is not satisfied with
risking his own money, but he must needs go into
debt, and then come to me to help him out.
It would have been bad enough if he had bought
more than he could afford to pay for, but it is
unthinkable that he should go and stake more
money than he has got. A stop must be put
to it somehow; I could not go home and look
my father in the face, knowing that I was
standing by without raising a finger to stop
Tom from being ruined.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he is all right,” said Bobby, who looked
rather sheepish and ill at ease. “All kids go
in for flutters of this sort, and it does them no
end of good to singe their wings a bit. He’ll
learn caution as he gets older—they all do.
Besides, if he had won, you would not have
made any stir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps if Tom had won I should not
have known anything about it,” Dorothy said
a little bitterly. “It is not merely his own
wings that Tom has singed, it is my wings
that have been burned. I am not going to
sit down under it. You are the cause of the
trouble, for it is you who have got up the
sweepstake. Blanche said so, and she seemed
no end proud of you for doing it, poor dear
little kid. But I am not proud of it. I think
you are horrid and low down to go corrupting
the morals of boys younger than yourself,
teaching them to gamble, and then getting your
pockets filled with the money you have won
from them. I don’t want anything more to
do with you, and in future I am going to cut
you dead. Good evening!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy slid away from Bobby as she spoke,
and slipping round behind an advancing couple,
she was out of the room in a moment, and fleeing
upstairs for all she was worth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had made her standpoint clear, but she
felt scared at her own audacity in doing it.
She could not be sure that it had done any
good, and she was downright miserable about
Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of choice, she would have gone to the Head,
and laid Tom’s case before her. But such a
thing was impossible. She could not submit
to being written down sneak and tell-tale,
and all the rest of the unpleasant titles that
would be indulged in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Staying upstairs as long as she dared, trying
to cool her burning cheeks, Dorothy stood
with her face pressed against the cold glass
of the landing window. Presently she heard
a girl in the hall below asking another where
to find Dorothy Sedgewick; and so she came
down, and passing the big open doors of the
lecture hall where they were dancing, she went
into the drawing-room, intending to find a quiet
corner, and to stay there for the rest of the
evening if she could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margaret found her presently, and dragged
her off to dance again. She saw Bobby Felmore
coming towards her with a set purpose on his
face, but she whirled round, and cutting him
dead, as she had said she would, she seized
upon Wilkins Minor, a small boy with big
spectacles, and asked him to dance with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is putting the shoe on the wrong
foot; you ought to wait until I ask you,” said
the boy with a swagger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I will wait, if you will make haste
about the asking,” she answered with a laugh;
and then she said, “You dance uncommonly
well, I know, because I have watched you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilkins Minor screwed up his nose in a grin
of delight, and bowing low he said, with a
flourish of his hands, “Miss Sedgewick, may
I have the pleasure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may,” said Dorothy with great fervour.
Then she and the small boy whirled round
with an abandon which, if it was not complete
enjoyment, was a very good imitation of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was waiting for her when she was
through with Wilkins Minor—Tom, with a
haggard look on his face, and such a devouring
anxiety in his eyes that her heart ached for
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you got that money for me?” he
asked. He grabbed her by the arm, leading her
out to the conservatory to find a quiet place
where they could talk without interruption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want it for?” she asked.
“See, Tom, this is the third time this term
you have come to me to lend you money you
never attempt to pay back. You have as much
as I have, and it does not seem fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, if you are going to cut up nasty about
it, then I have no more to say.” Tom flung
away in a rage. But he did not go far; in a
minute he was back at her side again, pleading
and pleading, his face white and miserable.
“Look here, old thing, you’ve always been a
downright good sport—the sort of a sister any
fellow would be glad to have—and it isn’t like
you to fail me when I’m in such an awful hole.
Just you lend me that five shillings, and you
shall have a couple of shillings for interest
when I pay it back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you be so horrid, Tom?” she
cried in great distress. “You are making it
appear as if it is just merely the money that is
worrying me. I know that you have been
gambling. You know very well that there
is nothing in the world that would upset Dad
more if he found it out, while Mums would
pretty well break her heart about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t gambling; it was only a sweepstake
that Bobby Felmore got up. All the fellows
are in it, and half of them are as badly bitten
as I am,” he explained gloomily. “Of course,
if I had won it would have been a different
matter altogether. I should have been in funds
for quite a long while; I could have paid you
back what I have had, and given you a present
as well. You wouldn’t have groused at me
then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that you would not have stood
it if I had,” she corrected him. Then she did
a battle with herself. Right at the bottom of
her heart she knew that she ought not to let
him have the money—that she ought to make
him suffer now, to save him suffering later on.
But it was dreadful to her to see Tom in such
distress; moreover, she was telling herself perhaps
she could safeguard him for the future
by making him promise that he would never
gamble again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, are you going to let me have it?”
he demanded, coming to stand close beside
her, and looking down at her with such devouring
anxiety in his eyes that she strangled
back a little sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will let you have it on one condition,” she
said slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s have it, then, and I will promise any
mortal thing you like to ask me,” he burst
out eagerly, his face sparkling with returning
hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have got to promise me that you will
never gamble again,” she said firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew! Oh, come now, that is a bit too
stiff, surely,” growled Tom, falling back a step,
while the gloom dropped over his face again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t help it. They are my terms; take them
or leave them as you like,” she said with decision.
But she felt as if a cold hand had gripped
her heart, as she saw how he was trying to back
out of giving the promise for which she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean to say that you won’t give
me the money if I don’t promise?” he asked,
scowling at her in the blackest anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do mean it,” she answered quietly, and
she looked at him in the kindest fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must have the cash, even if I have
to steal it,” he answered, with an attempt at
lightness that he plainly did not feel. “I
promise I won’t do it again; so hand over the
oof, there’s a good soul, and let us be quit of
the miserable business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You really mean what you say—that you
will not gamble again?” asked Dorothy a little
doubtfully, for his manner was too casual to inspire
confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I mean it. Didn’t I say so?
What more do you want?” His tone was
irritable, and his words came out in jerks.
“Do you want me to go down on my knees,
or to swear with my hand on the Bible, or any
other thing of the sort?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a goat, Tommy lad,” she said
softly, and then she slipped two half-crowns
into his hand, and hoped that she had done
right, yet feeling all the time a miserable insecurity
in her heart about his keeping his
promise to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made an excuse to slip away soon after
he had got the money, and Dorothy turned
back into the drawing-room in search of diversion.
She quickly had it, too—only it was not
the sort she wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby Felmore was prowling round the
almost empty room, studying the portraits of
the founders of the Compton Schools, as if he
were keenly interested in art; but he wheeled
abruptly at sight of her, and came towards her
with eager steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been nosing round to find you. Where
have you been hiding?” he said, beaming on
her. “Come along and have another dance
before chucking-out time. I thought I should
have had a fit to see that young bantam chick,
Wilkins Minor, toting you round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said I did not intend dancing with you
again, and I meant it,” she said coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said ‘unless,’ but you did not explain
what that meant.” He thought he had caught
her, and stood smiling in a rather superior
fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy coloured right up to the roots of
her hair. The thing she had to say was not easy,
but because she was in dead earnest she screwed
up her courage to go through with it, and said
in calm tones, “The ‘unless’ I spoke about was,
if you had seen fit to pay back what you have
had from the boys for that sweepstake you
got up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A likely old story, that I should be goat
enough to do that, after winning the money!”
He burst into a derisive laugh at the bare
suggestion of such a thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy turned away. There was a little
sinking at her heart. She really liked Bobby,
and they had been great pals since she had
come to the Compton School. If he could
not do this thing that she had put before him
as her ultimatum, then there was no more
to be said, and they must just go their separate
ways, for, having made up her mind as to what
was right, she was not going to give way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean that you are going to stick
to it?” he said, catching at her hand as she
turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I mean it, and you know that
I am right, too,” she said, turning back so
that she could stand confronting him. “You
know as well as I do that gambling in any shape
or form is forbidden here, and yet you not only
do it yourself, but you teach smaller fellows
than yourself to gamble, and you fill your
pocket by the process. You are about the
meanest sort of bounder I have seen for a long
time, and I would rather not have anything
more to do with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you are the limit, to talk like that to
me,” snarled Bobby, who was as white as paper
with rage, while his eyes bulged and shot out
little snappy lights, and Dorothy felt more than
half scared at the tempest she had raised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had right on her side. She knew it.
And Bobby knew it too, but it did not make
him feel any nicer about it at the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then a crowd of girls came scurrying
into the room. The foremost of them was
Rhoda, and she called out in her high-pitched,
sarcastic voice, “What are you two doing here?
The other fellows are just saying good night
to the Head, and you will get beans, Bobby
Felmore, if you are not there at the tail end of
the procession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For once in her life Dorothy was downright
grateful to Rhoda. Bobby had to go then,
and he went in a hurry. Dorothy could not
comfort herself that she had had the last word,
since it was really Bobby who had spoken last.
But at least it was she who had dictated terms,
and so she had scored in that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not encounter Bobby again until
the next Sunday afternoon. It was the last
Sunday of the term, and only a few boys had
come over to see their sisters. It was a miserable
sort of day, cold wind and drizzling rain,
so that nearly every one was in the drawing-room
or the conservatory, and only a few extra
intrepid individuals had gone out walking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was looking for Tom. She could
not find him anywhere, and was making up
her mind that he had not come over when
she encountered Bobby coming in at the open
window of the drawing-room, just as she was
going out to the conservatory in a final search
for Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby jerked his head higher in the air at
sight of her, and stood back to let her pass, but
he took no more notice of her than if she had
been an utter stranger. Dorothy’s pride flamed
up, and with a cold little bow she went past,
walking along between the banks of flowering
plants, and not seeing any of them. It was
horrid of Bobby to treat her like that. Of
course she had said that she would cut him
dead—she had done it too—but that was a vastly
different matter from being cut by him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, I had to speak, and I am glad that I
did. I don’t want to have anything to do with
any one who will teach younger boys to break
rules, and then will get rich at their expense,”
she whispered to herself in stormy fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went the length of the conservatory,
and was just coming back, deciding that for
some unknown reason Tom had not come over,
when Charlotte Flint of the Fourth called out
to her,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your brother Tom has gone out for a walk
with Rhoda Fleming. I saw them go; they
slipped out of the lower gate, and went down
the road as if they were going on to the
Promenade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy groaned. She did not want to go
out walking that afternoon; the weather was
of the sort to make indoors seem the nicer
place. But if she did not go, there would be
trouble for Tom, and for Rhoda too. So she
scurried into the cloakroom, and putting on
boots and mackintosh, let herself out by the
garden door, meaning to slip out of the lower
gate as they had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Groome came into the hall as she was
going out by the garden door, and she said,
“Oh, Dorothy, do you know it is raining?
Are you going for a walk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going a little way with Tom, only he
has started first,” she answered with a nod and
a smile; and then she scurried away, grateful
for the Sunday afternoon liberty, which made
it possible for a girl to take her own way within
certain limits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would not be pleasant walking with Rhoda
and Tom, for Rhoda would certainly say
malicious things, and Tom was not feeling
pleased with her because of the promise she
had exacted from him. But the only way
to save Rhoda from getting into trouble was
for her to be there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was to be a breaking-up festivity over
at the boys’ school on Tuesday night. If
Rhoda was hauled up for breaking rules to-day,
she might easily be shut out from that pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda and Tom were sheltering from the
rain under the railway arch at the bottom of
the lane; it was too wet and windy to face the
Promenade. They walked back to the school
with Dorothy, but neither of them appeared
the least bit grateful for her interference.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap14'>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<h3>TOP OF THE SCHOOL</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The Christmas vacation went past in a
whirl of merry-making. It was delightful
to be at home again, and to do all the
accustomed things. Dorothy hugged her happiness,
and told herself she was just the most
fortunate girl in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom at home was a very different person
from Tom at school, swanking round with
Rhoda Fleming. Dorothy felt she had her
chum back for the time, and she made the
most of it. Her common sense told her that
when they were back at school once more he
might easily prove as disappointing as he had
done in the past, so it was up to her to make
the most of him now that he was so satisfactory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One bit of news he told her three days after
they got home which interested her immensely.
She was sitting by the dining-room fire in the
twilight making toast for her father’s tea, because
he was out on a long, cold round in the
country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom was lolling in a big chair on the other
side of the fire, when suddenly he shoved his
hands deeper in his pocket, and pulling out
two half-crowns, tossed them into her lap,
saying with a chuckle, “There is your last
loan returned with many thanks. I did not
have to pay up after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” she asked, as she
picked up the money and looked at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom laughed again. “Some sort of a
microbe bit Bobby Felmore, and bit him
uncommon sharp, too. He suddenly turned
good, and paid back all the money he had won
from the sweepstake, treated us to a full-blown
lecture on the immorality of gambling, and
announced that in the future he stood for law
and order, and all the rest of that sort of piffle.
Of course we cheered him to the echo, for we
had got our money back, but we reckoned him
a mug for not having the sense to keep it when
he had got it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy felt the colour surge right up to
the roots of her hair; she was very thankful
it was too dark for Tom to see how red her
face was. Then, because she had to say something,
she asked, “What made him do that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had got a bee in his bonnet, I should
say,” answered Tom with an amused laugh.
“It was great to hear old Bobby lecturing us
on what sort of citizens we have got to be, and
rot of that sort. Of course we took it meekly
enough—why not? We had got our money
back, and could do a flutter in some other
direction if we wished. Oh, he is a mug, is
Bobby. He doesn’t think small beer of himself
either. They are county people, the Felmores.
In fact, I rather wonder that they come to the
Compton Schools. But they say that old
Felmore has great faith in boys and girls being
educated side by side, as it were, and allowed
to mix and mingle in recreation time. There
would be more sense, to my way of thinking,
if the mixing and the mingling were not so
messed up and harassed by silly little rules.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it is awfully decent of Bobby to
give the money back,” said Dorothy, and then
she had to turn her attention to the toast, which
was getting black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I, since I am able to pay you back,
and get free of that stupid promise you insisted
on,” answered Tom, lazily stretching himself
in the deep chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy picked up the two half-crowns and
held them out to him. “You can have the
money, and I will hold your promise still.
Oh, it will be cheap at five shillings. Take it,
Tommy lad, and go a bust with it; but I have
your promise that you will not gamble, and I
am going to keep you up to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not this time you are not,” he said, and
there was a surly note in his voice. “You
worried the promise out of me when I was fair
desperate. Now, I have paid the money back,
and I will not be bound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy realized the uselessness of urging
the point, and pocketed the money. She tried
to comfort herself that she would exact the
same promise if Tom appealed to her for help
again, yet could not help a feeling of disquiet
because of the tone he had taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was wild weather when they went back
to the Compton Schools. There was deep
snow on the ground that was fast being turned
into deep slush, and a fierce gale was hurtling
through the naked woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy went to work with a will. Indeed,
she had contrived to do quite a lot of work
during the vacation, and it told immediately
on her Form position. Week by week she
rose, and when the marks were put on the
board at the end of the third week of the term
she was at the top of the school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls gave her a great ovation that night;
the row they made was fairly stupendous. She
was carried in a chair round and round the
lecture hall, until the chair, a shaky one, collapsed
and let her down on to the enthusiasts
who were celebrating her victory, and they all
tumbled in a heap together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next week she was top again; but now
it was Rhoda Fleming who was next below
her, and Rhoda was putting her whole strength
into the task of beating Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next week was a really fearful struggle.
Dorothy worked with might and main; but
all along she had the feeling that she was going
to be beaten. And beaten she was, for when
the marks were put up on the board it was
found that Rhoda was top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was another ovation this week, but
it lacked the whole-hearted fervour of the one
given to Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda Fleming was not very popular. Her
tendency to swank made the girls dislike her,
and her fondness for snubbing girls whom she
considered her social inferiors was also against
her. Still, there can mostly be found some
who will shout for a victor, and so she had her
moment of triumph, which she proceeded to
round off in a manner that pleased herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meeting Dorothy at the turn of the stairs
a little later in the evening, she said, with a low
laugh that had a ring of malice in it, “I have
scored, you see, Miss Prig, in spite of all your
clever scheming, and I shall score all along.
I have twice your power, if only I choose to
put it out; and I am going to win the Lamb
Bursary somehow, so don’t you forget it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy laughed—Rhoda’s tendency to brag
always did amuse her. Then she answered in a
merry tone, “If the Mutton Bone depended
on the striving of this week, and next, and even
the week after, I admit that there would not
seem much hope for the rest of us; but our
chance lies in the months of steady work that
we have to face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda tossed her head with an air of conscious
power, and came a step nearer; she
even gripped Dorothy by the arm, and giving
it a little shake, said in a low tone, “I suppose
you are telling yourself that I am not fit to
have the Mutton Bone; but you would have
to prove everything you might say against me,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy blanched. She felt as if her trembling
limbs would not support her. But she
rallied her courage, and looking Rhoda straight
in the face, she said calmly, “What makes you
suggest that I have anything to bring against
you? Of your own choice you enrolled for
the Bursary. You declared in public that there
was no reason why you should not enrol; so the
responsibility lies with you, and not with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Rhoda’s turn to pale now, and she
went white to her very lips. “What do you
mean by that?” she gasped, and she shook
Dorothy’s arm in a sudden rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you two doing here?” inquired
a Form-mistress, coming suddenly upon them
round the bend of the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were just talking, Miss Ball,” replied
Rhoda, with such thinly veiled insolence that
the Fourth Form mistress flushed with anger,
and spoke very sharply indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you will at once leave off ‘just talking,’
as you call it, and get to work. No wonder
the younger girls are given to slackness when
you of the Sixth set them such an example of
laziness. I am very much inclined to report
you both to your Form-mistress.” Miss Ball
spoke with heat—the insult of Rhoda’s manner
rankled, and she was not disposed to pass
it by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray report us if you wish, and then Miss
Groome can do as she pleases about giving us
detention school; it would really be rather a
lark.” Rhoda laughed scornfully. “I am top
of the whole school this week, Dorothy was top
last week and the week before; so you can see
how necessary it is for us to be reported for
slackness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very rude.” Miss Ball was nearly
spluttering with anger, but Rhoda grew suddenly
calm, and she bowed in a frigid fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We thank you for your good opinion; pray
report us if you see fit,” she drawled, then went
her way, leaving Dorothy to bear alone the
full force of the storm which she herself had
raised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was some tempest, too. Miss Ball was
a very fiery little piece, and she had often had
to smart under the lash of Rhoda’s sarcasm.
She was so angry that she completely overlooked
the fact of Dorothy’s entire innocence of
offence, and she raged on, saying all the hard
things which came into her mind, while Dorothy
stood silent and embarrassed, longing to escape,
yet seeing no chance to get away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anything wrong, Miss Ball?” It was
the quiet voice of the Head that spoke. She had
come upon the scene without either Miss Ball
or the victim hearing her approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have had to reprimand some of these
girls of the Sixth for wasting their own time,
and teaching, by example, the younger girls to
become slackers also,” said Miss Ball, who
looked so ashamed at being caught in the act
of bullying that Dorothy felt downright sorry
for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think we can write Dorothy down
a slacker,” said the Head kindly, and there was
such a twinkle of fun in her eyes that Dorothy
badly wanted to laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Example stands for a tremendous lot,”
said Miss Ball. “The Sixth are very supercilious,
even rude, in their manner to the Form-mistresses,
and it is not to be borne without a
protest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! that is a different matter,” said the
Head, becoming suddenly brisk and active.
“Do I understand that you are bringing a
charge against the Sixth collectively, or as
individuals?—Dorothy, you can go.—Miss
Ball, come into my room, and we will talk the
matter out quietly and in comfort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was only too thankful to escape.
It was horrid of Rhoda to treat a mistress in
such a fashion. It was still more horrid of
her to go away leaving all the brunt of it to fall
upon Dorothy, who was entirely unoffending.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hazel and Margaret soothed her with their
sympathy when she reached the haven of the
study, and even Jessie Wayne tore herself out
of her books to give her a kindly word. Then
they all settled down to steady work again, and
a hush was on the room, until a Fifth Form
girl came up with a message that the Head
wanted to see Dorothy at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As bad as that?” cried Hazel in consternation.
“Oh, Dorothy, I am sorry for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect I shall survive,” answered Dorothy
with a rather rueful smile, and then she went
downstairs to the private room of the Head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Dorothy, what have you to say about
this storm in a teacup?” asked the Head,
motioning Dorothy to a low seat by the fire,
while she herself remained sitting at her writing
table. A stately and gracious woman, she was,
with such a light of kindness and sympathy in
her eyes that every girl who came to her felt
assured of justice and considered care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it was rather a storm in a teacup,”
Dorothy answered, smiling in her turn, yet on
the defensive, for she did not know of how
much she had been accused by Miss Ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were you doing on the stairs just
then?” asked the Head; and looking at
Dorothy, she was secretly amused at the
thought of catechising a girl of the Sixth in
this fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was going up to the study,” said Dorothy.
“I met Rhoda, who was coming down from
her study; we stopped to speak about her
having ousted me from the top. We were still
talking when Miss Ball came, and—and she
said we were slackers, and setting a bad example
to the rest of the girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That much I have already gathered,” said
the Head. “But I am not quite clear as to what
came after. What had you said that caused
such a storm of angry words from Miss Ball?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy smiled. She really could not help
it—she had been so completely the scapegoat
for Rhoda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had said nothing,” she answered slowly.
Then seeing that the Head still waited, she
hesitated a moment, then went on. “I think
Miss Ball was just pouring out her anger upon
me because Rhoda had slipped away, and only
I was left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rhoda was rude to Miss Ball?” asked the
Head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think she was more offensive in manner
than in actual words,” said Dorothy, very
anxious to be fair to Rhoda, just because of
the secret repulsion in her heart, which had
to be fought and to be kept down out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought perhaps that was what it was
all about.” The Head heaved a little sigh of
botherment—so it seemed to Dorothy—and
then she said in her sweetly gracious manner,
“Thank you for helping me out. I knew I
should get the absolute truth from you.”</p>

<h3>AT HIGH TIDE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Sowergate felt the full force of a
south-westerly gale; sometimes heavy seas
would be washing right over the Promenade,
flooding the road beyond, and rendering it
impassable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was great fun to go walking by the sea
at such times. There was the excitement of
dodging the great waves as they broke over the
broad sea-wall, and there was the sense of
adventure in braving the perils of the road,
which at such times was apt to be strewn with
wreckage of all sorts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the early part of February the weather
was so stormy that for three days the girls
could not get out, their only exercise being
the work in the gymnasium. Of course this
meant fresh air of a sort, since they had the
whole range of the landward windows open,
and the breeze was enough to turn a good-sized
windmill. But it was not out of doors by any
means, and it was out of doors for which every
one was pining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the fourth day the wind was still blowing
big guns—indeed, it was blowing more than it
had been; but as it did not rain, the whole
school turned out to struggle along the Promenade.
Miss Mordaunt, the games-mistress,
was for going up the hill to the church, and
taking a turn through the more sheltered lanes
beyond. But the mud was deep in that direction;
moreover, every girl of them all was
longing to see the great waves at play: and,
provided they kept a sharp look-out in passing
Sowergate Point, it was not likely they would
get a drenching. So the crocodile turned down
the hill outside the school gates, and took its
way along the Promenade in the direction of
Ilkestone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were very few people abroad this
morning; the bus traffic had been diverted
during the heavy weather, and sent round by
way of the camp. The crocodile had the road
to themselves, and great fun they found it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was quite impossible to walk on the
Promenade, for it was continually being swept
by heavy seas. Even on the path at the far
side of the road they had to dodge the great
wash of water from breaking waves. Then the
crocodile broke into little scurrying groups of
girls, there were shrieks and bubbling laughter,
and every one declared it was lovely fun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mordaunt was in front with the younger
ones; it was very necessary that a mistress
should be there to pick the road, to hold them
back when a stream of water threatened them,
and to choose when to make a rush to avoid
an incoming wave. Miss Groome was at the
other end of the crocodile, and those of the
Sixth out walking that morning were with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had reached as far as the point where
the flight of steps go up to the Military Hospital,
when a taxi came along the road at a great
rate, mounting the path here and there to avoid
the holes in the road which had been washed
out by the battering of the sea-water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mordaunt promptly herded the front
half of the crocodile on to the space which in
normal times was a pleasant strip of garden
ground. The other half fell back in a confused
group round Miss Groome, while the
taxi came on at a rate which made it look as
if the driver were drunk or demented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The group squeezed themselves flat against
the railings—time to run away there was not.
Indeed, to stand still seemed the safest way,
as the driver would at least have a better chance
of avoiding them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly they saw that there was purpose
in his haste. A tremendous wave was racing
inshore, and he, poor puny human, was trying
with all the power of the machinery under his
control to run away from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He might as well have tried to run away
from the wind. With a swirling rush the big
wave struck the sea-wall, mounted in a towering
column of spray, and dashing on to the Promenade,
struck one of the iron seats, wrenched it
from its fastenings, and hurled it across the road
right on to the bonnet of the taxi at the moment
when it was passing the huddled group of
girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind screen was smashed, splinters of
glass flying in all directions. The driver hung
on to his wheel in spite of the deluge of broken
glass; he put on the brakes. But before he
could bring the car to a stand the door was
wrenched open, and a stout woman, shrieking
shrilly, had hurled herself from the car, falling
in a heap among the startled girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was the first one to sense what was
happening, and being quick to act, had spread
her arms, and so broken the fall of the screaming
woman. The force of the impact bowled
her over; but as she fell against the thickly-clustered
group of girls, no great harm was
done. The wind was fairly knocked out of
her, for the woman was bulky in size, and in
such a fearful state of agitation, too, that it
was as if she had been overwhelmed by an
avalanche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, oh, oh! What a truly awful experience,
my dear! I should have been killed outright
if it had not been for you!” cried the poor
lady; and then, slipping her arms about Dorothy’s
neck, she half-strangled her in a frantic
sort of embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was surely a great risk for you to take,
to jump in such a fashion,” said Miss Groome
severely. As she spoke she came close to the
frightened woman, who was still clinging fast
to Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to jump—I was simply rained upon
with splinters of broken glass. See how I am
bleeding,” said the unfortunate one, whose
face was cut in several places with broken
glass. She was elderly, she was clad in expensive
furs, and was unmistakably a lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The taxi-driver reached them at this moment;
his face was also cut and bleeding. He reported
that his car was so badly damaged that
he would not be able to continue his journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I could not have gone any farther,
even if the car had escaped injury. I am almost
too frightened to live,” moaned the poor lady,
who was trembling and hysterical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The taxi-driver treated her with great deference
and respect. Seeing how shaken she was,
he appealed to Miss Groome to know what was
the best thing to be done for the comfort of
his hurt and badly frightened fare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is the police station; she could rest
here while you find another car to take her
back to Ilkeston,” said Miss Groome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will do very nicely, and thank you
for being so kind,” said the lady, who was still
clinging fast to Dorothy. “I wonder if you
would be so kind as to permit this dear girl,
who saved me from falling, to go with me to
my hotel? I am staying at the Grand, in
Ilkestone. The car that takes me there could
bring her back. I feel too shaken to go
alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dorothy could go, of course,” said Miss
Groome. But her tone was anxious; she did
not like allowing even a grown-up girl of the
Sixth to go off with a complete stranger.
“Would you not rather have some one a little
older to take care of you? Miss Mordaunt
would go with you, or I can hand the girls
over to her, and go with you myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, I would not permit such a thing!”
exclaimed the lady, waving away the suggestion
with great energy and determination. “You
have duties to perform; your absence even for
a couple of hours might mean serious dislocation
of machinery. But this dear girl—Dorothy,
did you call her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Dorothy Sedgewick,” said
Dorothy, her voice having a muffled sound by
reason of one arm of the lady being still round
her neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a daughter of Dr. Randolph Sedgewick
of Farley in Buckinghamshire?” demanded
the lady in great excitement, giving
Dorothy a vigorous shake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—that is my father.” Dorothy smiled
happily into the face that was so near to her
own—it was so pleasant to encounter some one
who knew her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, your father is a very old friend
of mine. I am Mrs. Peter Wilson, of Fleetwood
Park, near Sevenoaks. It is quite possible
you may not have heard him speak of me
by my married name; but you have surely
heard him talk of Rosie O’Flynn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That wild girl Rosie O’Flynn, is that the
one you mean?” asked Dorothy, smiling
broadly at the recollection of some of the stories
her father had told of the madcap doings of
the aforesaid Rosie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes; but I have altered a good deal
since those days,” said Mrs. Wilson with a
gasping sigh. “I should have welcomed an
experience of this sort then, but now it has
shaken me up very badly indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I go with Mrs. Wilson to the Grand?”
asked Dorothy, turning to Miss Groome with
entreaty in her eyes. What a wonderful sort
of adventure this was, that she should have had
her father’s old friend flung straight into her
arms!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, certainly you may go,” said Miss
Groome, who was decidedly relieved at hearing
of the social status of the lady. “But, Dorothy,
you must come back in the car that takes Mrs.
Wilson to the Grand, for I am sure you must
be wet. It will be very unsafe for you to be
long without changing. Ah! here comes the
driver, and he has another car coming along
after him; that is fortunate, because Mrs.
Wilson will not have to wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I have to send Dorothy straight back
to-day, may I have the pleasure of her company
to tea to-morrow afternoon at four o’clock?”
asked Mrs. Wilson, holding out her hand with
such friendliness that Miss Groome at once
gave consent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The driver had secured a taxi from the Crown
Inn at Sowergate, and the driver of the fresh
car took his way with infinite care along the
wreckage-strewn road to Ilkestone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wilson was fearfully nervous. She
kept crying out; she would have jumped out
more than once during the journey if Dorothy
had not held her down by sheer force of arm,
beseeching her to be calm, and promising that
no harm should come to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know that I am behaving like a silly
baby; but, my dear, I have no nerve left,” said
the poor lady, who was almost hysterical with
agitation. “I am not very well—I ought to
be in peace and quiet at Fleetwood—but I had
to come on rather unpleasant business about a
nephew of mine who is at the Gunnery School
at Hayle. I suppose I shall have to go back
to Sevenoaks with the business undone, unless
I can do it from Ilkestone, for certainly I
cannot make another journey along that wreckage-strewn
road beyond Sowergate. Oh! it
was awful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was rather grand and terrible; I have
never seen anything like it before,” replied
Dorothy, who had been really thrilled by the
sight of the tremendous seas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can do without such sights; I would
rather have things on a more peaceful scale,”
sighed Mrs. Wilson, whose face was mottled
with little purply patches from the shock of
the accident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy helped her out of the car when they
reached the Grand. She went up in the lift
to the suite of rooms on the first floor which
Mrs. Wilson occupied. She handed the poor
fluttered lady into the care of the capable
maid, and then came back to Sowergate in the
car.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap16'>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<h3>A STARTLING REVELATION</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Once—that was in her first term—Dorothy
had gone with Hazel and Margaret to tea
with Margaret’s mother at Ilkestone; but with
that exception she had had no invitations out
since she had been at the Compton School,
so that it was really a great pleasure to be asked
to take tea with Mrs. Wilson at the Grand
next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She reached the hotel punctually at four
o’clock. She was shot up in the lift, and was
met at the door of Mrs. Wilson’s suite by the
same very capable maid whom she had seen
the day before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told Dorothy that Mrs. Wilson was still
very unnerved and shaken from the effects of
the previous day’s happenings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The doctor says she must not be allowed
to talk very much about it, if you please, miss;
so if you could get her interested in anything
else it would be a very good thing.” The
maid spoke rather anxiously, and she seemed
so concerned, that Dorothy cheerfully undertook
to keep the lady’s mind as far away from
Sowergate as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wilson was lying back in a deep chair,
and she looked pale and ill. She roused herself
to welcome Dorothy, and began to talk
of the previous day’s happenings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think I am like my father?”
Dorothy asked, as soon as she could get Mrs.
Wilson’s thoughts a little away from the forbidden
subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little, but the likeness is more of manner
than of feature. I suppose you take after your
mother, for you are very nice looking, which
your father never was.” Mrs. Wilson surveyed
Dorothy with a critical air, seeming to be well
pleased with her scrutiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy flushed an uncomfortable red; it
looked as if she had been asking for compliments,
whereas nothing had been farther from
her thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about my father, please,” she said
hurriedly, intent on keeping the talk well away
from recent happenings, yet anxious to avoid
any further reference to her own looks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he was a wild one in those days!”
Mrs. Wilson gurgled into sudden laughter at
her remembrances. “Your father, his cousin
Arthur Sedgewick, with Fred and Francis
Bagnall, were about the most rackety set of
young men it would be possible to find anywhere,
I should think. By the way, where is
Arthur Sedgewick now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy looked blank. “I do not think I
have ever heard of him,” she answered slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! then I expect he died many years ago,
most likely before you were born. A wild one
was Arthur Sedgewick. But your father ran
him close, and the two Bagnalls were not far
behind. I was rather in love with Fred Bagnall
at the time, while he fairly adored the
ground I walked upon. Ah me! I don’t think
the girls of the present day get the whole-hearted
devotion from their swains that used
to fall to our lot. We should have made a
match of it, I dare say, if I had not gone to
Dublin for a winter and met Peter Wilson
there. Oh, these little ifs, what a difference
they make to our lives!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wilson was interrupted at the moment
by the entrance of the maid, who started to
lay the table for tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need not stop to wait on us, Truscot,”
said Mrs. Wilson, who already looked brighter
and better from having some one to talk to.
“Miss Sedgewick will pour out the tea for
me, and you can get a little walk; you have
had no chance of fresh air to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Truscot departed well pleased, and Mrs.
Wilson sank back in her chair absorbed in
those recollections of the past, which had the
power to make her laugh still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did father live when you knew
him?” asked Dorothy. “Had he settled in
Buckinghamshire then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no,” said Mrs. Wilson. “He was on
the staff at Guy’s Hospital when I first knew
him, and afterwards he was in Hull. That
was where I became acquainted with the Bagnalls
and with Arthur Sedgewick. Oh, the
larks we used to have, and the mischief those
young men got into!” Mrs. Wilson’s laughter
broke out again at the recollection, but Dorothy
looked a little bit disturbed. This was quite
a new light on her quiet, hard-working father,
and she was not at all sure that she liked it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so strange to hear of Dad playing
pranks,” she said, and a little chill crept over
her. To her Dr. Sedgewick stood as an
embodiment of steadfastness and power—the
one man in the world who could do no wrong—the
man who could always be depended on
for right judgment and uprightness of conduct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wilson’s laughter cackled out again,
and suddenly it grew distasteful to Dorothy,
She wished she had not come; but it was
rather late in the day for wishing that now.
The lady went on talking. “I remember the
time when we had all been to a dance at
Horsden Priory. Mrs. Bagnall was chaperoning
me—we had chaperones in those days, but
we managed to dodge them sometimes. I did
it that night, and we came home in a fly by
ourselves. The Bagnalls and I were riding
inside; your father and his cousin were on the
box. We painted the town red that night, for
we raced the Cordells and the Clarksons. We
ran into the police wagonette, and the upshot
of it all was that your father had to go to prison
for fourteen days; for, besides the police
wagonette being smashed up, an old woman
was knocked down and hurt. There was a
fine commotion at the time, but it was hushed
up, for the Bagnalls were county people, and
my father was furious because I was mixed
up in the business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you really mean that my father went to
prison?” asked Dorothy in a strained voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my dear, he did; the others deserved
to go—but, as I said before, the business was
hushed up as much as possible. Oh, but they
were great times! It was living then, but now
I merely exist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy heard the lady prosing on, but she
did not take in the sense of what was being
said. She was facing that ugly, stark fact
of her father having been in prison, and she
was trying to measure what it meant to her
personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a picture before the eyes of her
mind of the lecture hall at the Compton School:
she saw the Head sitting with several gentlemen
on the dais; she heard again the voice of one
of the gentlemen reading the conditions for
the enrolment of candidates for the Lamb
Bursary, and she heard as if it were the actual
voice speaking in her ear, “Whose parents
have not been in prison—” She had smiled to
herself at the time, thinking what a queer thing
it was to mention in reference to the highly
respectable crowd of girls gathered in the
lecture hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If she had only known of this escapade of her
father’s in the past she would not have dared
to enrol. She did not know, and so she had
become a candidate with full belief in her own
respectability. But now that she knew——</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wilson prosed on. She was talking
now of that winter she spent in Dublin, when
she met Peter Wilson, to whom she was married
later on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was conscious of answering yes,
and no, at what seemed like proper intervals.
She seemed to be sitting there through long
months, and years, and she began to wonder
whether she would be grey and bent with age
by the time the visit was over. Then suddenly
there was a soft knock at the door. Truscot
entered, and said that a lady had come for
Miss Sedgewick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was Miss Mordaunt, and Dorothy
came down in the lift to join her in the entrance
hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Dorothy, what is the matter with
you?” asked the games-mistress in consternation.
“Do you feel faint?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think the room was hot,” murmured
Dorothy in explanation, and then she turned
blindly in the direction of the great entrance
door, longing to feel the sweeping lift of the
strong wind from the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without a word Miss Mordaunt took her
by the arm, and led her out through the vestibule
to the open porch, standing with her there
to give her time to recover a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How good the wind was! There was a
dash of salt spray in it, too, which was wonderfully
reviving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out in the stormy west there was a rift of
colour yet, where the clouds had been torn
asunder, while a star winked cheerfully out
from a patch of sky that was clear of cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all very pleasant and very normal,
and Dorothy had the sensation of just waking
up from a particularly hideous nightmare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trouble was that the very worst part of
the nightmare was with her still. She could
not wake up from that, because it was a reality
and no dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feel better, do you?” asked Miss Mordaunt
kindly, as she noted a drift of colour coming
back to the pale face of Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, I am better now, thank you. I
shall be quite all right after we have walked
for a little way in the air. What a nice night
it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was going to take a bus, but we will walk
if you would like it better,” said Miss Mordaunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to walk; it is so cool and fresh
out here.” Dorothy was drawing long breaths
and revelling in the strong sweep of the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is funny how these elderly ladies will
have their rooms so fearfully overheated,” remarked
Miss Mordaunt; and then she asked
a string of questions about Dorothy’s visit,
the condition of Mrs. Wilson after her shock,
and that sort of thing, to all of which Dorothy
returned mechanical answers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mind was in a whirl still. She felt quite
unable to think clearly, and her outstanding
emotion was intense dislike to Mrs. Wilson,
whose bread and butter she had so recently
been eating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah, it is just horrid!” she exclaimed
aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it the mud you don’t like, or are you
tired of walking?” asked Miss Mordaunt a
little anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think there is any mud—none to
matter, at least—and I simply love walking at
night,” replied Dorothy. “I was thinking of
Mrs. Wilson, and of the perfumes in which she
is soaked, and the joss sticks that were burning
in the room most of the time that I was there.
Oh! the air was thick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you would feel bad in such an
atmosphere. Forget about it now. Think of
clean and wholesome things, of wide spaces
swept by wind and drenched with rain. Mind
is a mighty force, you know, and the person
who thinks of clean things feels clean, inside
and out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a nice idea!” cried Dorothy, and
then suddenly her hope roused again and
began to assert itself. For to-night, at least,
she would forget that ugly thing she had heard.
She would fix her mind on the path she meant
to climb, and climb she would, in spite of
everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the rest of the walk back to Sowergate,
and then up the hill to the Compton School,
she was merry and bright as of old, and Miss
Mordaunt was thankful indeed for the restoring
power of that walk in the fresh air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda Fleming was crossing the hall when
they went in, and she turned upon Dorothy
with a ready gibe. “It is fine to be you, going
out to take tea with county folks, and swanking
round generally. The one compensation we
stay-at-homes have is that we can get on with
our work, while you are doing the social
butterfly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even that compensation will seem rather
thin if I can work twice as fast, just because
I have been out,” answered Dorothy, smiling
back at Rhoda with such radiant good humour
that Rhoda was impressed in spite of herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going out seems to have bucked you up,
and I suppose you have had the time of your
life,” she said grudgingly. “For my own part,
I felt thankful yesterday because the good
lady chose to hang round your neck instead of
mine, but going to tea with her at the Grand,
Ilkestone, puts a different aspect on the affair.
I begin to wish she had clawed me instead of
you after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“History would have been written differently
if she had.” Dorothy’s laugh rippled out
as she spoke, but as she went upstairs to the
study she wondered what would have happened
if Mrs. Wilson had told Rhoda of that wild
doing of her father in those days of long ago.
Would Rhoda have held the knowledge over
her as a whip of knotted cords, or would she
have blurted the unpleasant story out to the
whole school without loss of time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a clamour there would have been!
Dorothy shivered as in fancy she heard the wild
tale going the round of the school, of how
Dr. Sedgewick had been in prison for a fortnight
in his reckless youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The secret was her own so far. She could
hide it until she had time to sort things out in
her mind. Meanwhile she would work. Ah,
how she would work! She must win that
Lamb Bursary. She must! Yet would she
dare to keep it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would she dare?</p>

<div><h1 id='chap17'>CHAPTER XVII</h1></div>

<h3>SETTING THE PACE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Hazel Dring, one of the most good-natured
of girls, was beginning to grumble.
Margaret Prime was beginning to despair.
Both of them were so much below Dorothy
and Rhoda in the matter of marks that their
chances of winning the Mutton Bone grew
every week more shadowy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes it was Rhoda who was top of the
school, more often it was Dorothy. Professor
Plimsoll talked with perfect rapture in his
tone of the pleasure it was to lecture for the
Compton Girls’ School, now that there were
such magnificent workers there. Miss Groome
was having the time of her life, and even the
Head declared that the strenuous work of the
Sixth must make its mark on the whole of
the school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Head was quite unusually sympathetic
in her nature. That is to say, she was more
than ordinarily swift to sense something hidden.
It was not according to nature, as she knew
schoolgirl nature, for two girls to work at the
pressure displayed by Dorothy and Rhoda.
She knew Rhoda to be lazy by nature, and
although ambitious, by no means the sort of
girl to keep up this fierce struggle week after
week. Dorothy was a worker by nature, but
the almost desperate earnestness that she displayed
was so much out of the common that
the Head was not satisfied all was right with
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The days were hard for Dorothy just then.
She lived in a constant strain of expecting
to hear from some one that the story told by
Mrs. Wilson had become public property. It
was just the sort of gossip a talkative person
would enjoy spreading. Dorothy writhed, as
in fancy she heard her father’s name bandied
from mouth to mouth, and the scathing comment
that would result. She even expected
to hear her position as candidate for the Lamb
Bursary challenged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was not at all clear in her own mind
about it being right for her to remain a candidate.
She had enrolled in ignorance of there
being any impediment, she was entirely innocent
of wrong in the matter, and as it was by
the purest accident she had learned the true
facts of the case, it seemed to her that there
was no need for her to withdraw, or to make
any declaration about the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, she was not at rest. The way in which
she eased her conscience on the matter savoured
a good deal of drugs and soothing powders.
When she felt most uneasy, then she just
worked the harder, and so drowned care in
work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The term wore on. February went out in
fierce cold, and March came in with tempests
one day, and summer sunshine the next.
Dorothy went down then with a sharp attack
of flu, and for a week was shut up in the san
fretting and fuming over her inability to work,
and was only consoled by discovering that
Rhoda had sprained her right wrist rather
badly at gym work, and was unable to do
anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hazel mounted to the top of the school in
marks that week, and the week following
Margaret took her down. The two declared
it was just like old times back again. But,
strangely enough, they were not so elated by
their victory as they might have been. Dorothy
had become in a very real sense their chum,
and her disaster could not fail to be something
of a trouble to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda was unpopular because of her unpleasant
trick of snubbing. Dorothy had a
way of making friends; she was sympathetic
and kind, which counted for a good deal,
and really outweighed Rhoda’s splashes of
generosity in the matter of treating special
friends to chocolates, macaroons, and that sort
of thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy came back to work looking very
much of a wreck, but with undiminished
courage for the fray. She could not recapture
her position at first. Hazel was top most weeks,
or was edged down by Margaret. Rhoda was
finding her sprained wrist a severe nuisance.
Being her right wrist, she could not write, and
having to trust so largely to her memory with
regard to lectures and that sort of thing, found
herself handicapped at every turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one thing in Rhoda’s limitation
that was a great comfort to Dorothy, and that
was the inability of Rhoda to write to Tom.
It had come to Dorothy’s knowledge, that
although Bobby Felmore was putting down
sweepstakes among the boys with a vigorous
hand, gambling in some form or other was still
going on, and Tom was mixed up in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda openly boasted in the Form-room of
having helped some friends of hers to win a
considerable sum of money by laying odds on
Jewel, Mr. Mitre’s horse that ran at Wrothamhanger.
Two days later, when Tom came over
to see Dorothy, he was more jubilant than she
had ever seen him, and he offered to pay back
the money he had borrowed from her last
term.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you manage to save it?” she asked,
with a sudden doubt of his inability to deny
himself enough to have saved so much in such
a short time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not save it, I made it,” he answered
easily. “The great thing with money is not
to hoard it, but to use it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could you use it, just a little money
like that, to make money again?” she asked in
a troubled tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed, but refused to explain. “Oh,
there are ways of doing things that girls—at
least some girls—don’t understand,” he said,
and refused to say anything more about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy handed the money back. “I think
I had better not take it,” she said with brisk
decision. “If you had made it honourably you
would be willing to say how it had been done.
If it is not clean money, I would rather not
have anything to do with it, thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, go without it, then—only don’t
taunt me another day with not having been
willing to pay my debts,” growled Tom,
pocketing the money so eagerly that it looked
as if he thought she might change her mind,
and want it back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom, how did you make that money?”
she asked. She was thinking of the boast
Rhoda had made of having helped a friend to
land a decent little sum of money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom laughed. He seemed very much
amused by her question. He would not tell her
how it had been done, but poked fun at her for
saying she would not take it because she was
afraid it had not been made in an honourable
fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is great to hear a girl prating about
honour, when every one knows girls have no
sense at all of honour in an ordinary way.”
He spread himself out and looked so killingly
superior when he said it, that she felt as if she
would like to slap him for making himself
appear so ridiculous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall know better how to respect your
sense of honour when I have heard how you
made that money,” she said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom flew all to pieces then, and abused her
roundly, as brothers will, for being a smug sort
of a prig. But he would not tell her anything
more about it, and he went away, leaving Dorothy
to meditate rather sadly on the way in
which Tom had changed of late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was another matter for thought in
what he had said. He had gibed at her again
about a girl’s sense of honour being inferior
to that of a man, and she, with that rankling,
secret knowledge of what had happened to her
father, began again to worry, and to wonder
what really she ought to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I shall not win the Mutton Bone,
and then it will not matter,” she murmured to
herself. Yet in her heart she knew very well
that she was going to strive with all her might
to win it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Miss Groome called her aside,
and put the local newspaper into her hand.
“Read that, Dorothy. I am so glad you had
a chance to be kind to the poor lady that day
on the front.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The paragraph to which Miss Groome
pointed was an announcement of the death of
Mrs. Peter Wilson, of Fleetwood Park, Sevenoaks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead, is she?” gasped Dorothy, her face
white and a great awe in her heart. Then
suddenly it flashed into her mind that if Mrs.
Wilson were dead, there would be no danger
of that disastrous fact leaking out of her father
having been in prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How good it was to be able to draw her
breath freely again! Dorothy went upstairs
to the study feeling as if she trod on air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one could know how she had dreaded
that Mrs. Wilson would gossip about that ugly
fact of the past to some one who would bring
the story to the school, and make it public
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, now, the danger was past! That
garrulous tongue was stilled, and the past
might lie buried for always. How good it
was!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy drew long breaths of satisfaction as
she sat down in her accustomed chair. How
good life was! How glorious it was to work,
and to achieve! Perhaps she would win the
Lamb Bursary. Then she would go to the
university. She would have her chance of
making a mark in the world, and—and——</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a sudden movement of her arm one of
the books piled round her on the table was
sent spinning to the floor. It opened as it
fell, and as she stooped to reach it she read on
the opened page—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“That which seemeth to die may only
be lying dormant, waiting until the set time
shall come, when it shall awake and arise,
ready to slay, or to ennoble, according as
it shall be written in the Book of Fate.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph! There does not seem to be
much comfort in that!” muttered Dorothy
under her breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the dear child prattling about,
and what gem of knowledge has it lighted on
from that old book, which might well have
been used to light a fire, say, a generation ago?”
Hazel leaned over from her corner of the table
to look curiously at the shabby old volume
Dorothy was holding in her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it is not so very old,” said Dorothy,
with a laugh. “To have consigned it to the
fire a generation ago would have been to burn
it before it had a being. It is only a dictionary
of quotations, and the one the book opened at
seemed to give the lie direct to the thing I was
thinking about. That is why I made noises
with my nose and my mouth, disturbing the
studious repose of this chamber of learning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chamber of learning be blowed! What is
the quote?” and Hazel stretched herself in a
languid fashion as she held out her hand for
the book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She read the quotation aloud, then in keener
interest demanded, “What do you make of it
anyhow? ‘To slay, or to ennoble, according
as it shall be written in the Book of Fate’—the
two ideas seem to knock each other over
like the figures in a Punch and Judy show.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what it means,” said Dorothy
slowly. “It gave me the sensation of there
being a dog waiting round the corner somewhere,
to jump out and bite me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a silly sheep, Dorothy; the meaning
is plain enough,” put in Margaret, who
had left her seat, and was leaning over Hazel,
staring down at the quotation. “What it
just means is this: we have in us wonderful
powers of free will, and the ability to make our
own fate. The thing that lies dormant, but
not dead, is the influence upon us of the things
we come up against in life. If we take them
one way they will slay us—that is, let us down
mentally, and morally, and every way; if we
take them the other way—perhaps the very
much harder way—they will lift us up and
make us noble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well done, old girl; you will be a senior
wrangler yet, even if Dorothy or Rhoda snatch
the Mutton Bone from your trembling jaws,”
cried Hazel, giving Margaret a resounding
whack on the back, while Jessie Wayne clapped
her hands in applause, and only Dorothy was
silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old quotation had hit her hard. Margaret’s
explanation of it hit her harder still.
She was thinking of the thing which had seemed
to fade out of life with the death of Mrs. Wilson,
and she was wondering what its effect would
be on her, and what was the writing for her
in the book of Fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margaret turned to her books again; but
before she plunged into them she said slowly,
“I think we are our own Fate—that is, we have
the power to be our own Fate.”</p>

<div><h1 id='chap18'>CHAPTER XVIII</h1></div>

<h3>THAT DAY AT HOME</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The term ended with Dorothy at the top
of the school, and she went home feeling
that the Lamb Bursary might be well within
her grasp, if only she could keep up her present
rate of work. The girl who was running her
hardest was Rhoda. Hazel and Margaret, very
close together in their weekly position, were
too far behind to be a serious menace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first thing which struck Dorothy when
she reached home was the careworn look of
her father. Dr. Sedgewick had not been very
well; some days it was all he could do to keep
about, doing the work of his large practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother, why doesn’t father have an assistant
to tide him over while he is so unfit?”
asked Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been home three days, and on this
particular morning she was helping her mother
in sorting and repairing house-linen, really a
great treat after the continuous grind of term.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Times are bad, and he does not feel that
he can afford the luxury of an assistant,” said
Mrs. Sedgewick with a sigh. “Dr. Bowles is
very good at helping him out: he has taken
night work for your father several times, which
is very good of him. I think that professional
men are really very good to each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Bowles ought to be good to father;
think how father worked for him when he had
rheumatic fever—so it is only paying back.”
Dorothy spoke with spirit, then asked, with
considerable anxiety in her tone, “Is it the
expense of my year at the Compton School
that is making it so hard for father just now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sedgewick hesitated. Of choice she
would have kept all knowledge of struggle from
the children, so that they might be care free
while they were young. But Dorothy had a
way of getting at the bottom of things—and
perhaps, after all, it was as well that she should
appreciate the sacrifice that was being made
for her. “We had to go rather carefully this
year on your account, of course. Tom is an
expense, too, for although he has a scholarship
there are a lot of odds and ends to pay for him
that take money. But we shall win through
all right. And if only you are able to get the
Lamb Bursary you will be set up for life—you
may even be able to help with the twins when
their turn for going away comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother, if I did not go in for the Lamb
Bursary, I could take a post as junior mistress
when I leave school; then I should be getting
a salary directly.” Dorothy spoke eagerly;
she was suddenly seeing a way out, in her
position with regard to the Mutton Bone—a
most satisfactory way out, so she said to herself,
as she thought of the horrible story of her
father’s past that had been told to her by Mrs.
Wilson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A look of alarm came into the face of Mrs.
Sedgewick, and she broke into eager protest.
“Don’t think of such a thing, Dorothy. A
mistress without a degree can never rise above
very third-rate work. Your father and I are
straining every nerve to fit you to take a good
place in the world; it is up to you to second
our efforts. You have got to win the Lamb
Bursary somehow. If you can do that your
father’s burden will be lifted, and he will have
so much less care. Oh! you must win it. We
sent you to the Compton School because of
that chance, and you must not disappoint us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy shivered. Next moment a hot
resentment surged into her heart. She was
doing her best to win it, and it was not her
fault that in real truth she was not eligible
for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had told her mother of her meeting with
Mrs. Wilson. What she did find impossible
to tell Mrs. Sedgewick was about the stories
Mrs. Wilson had told her of her father’s past;
there was a certain aloofness about Mrs.
Sedgewick—she always seemed to keep her
children at arm’s length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Greatly daring, Dorothy did try to find out
what she could about those old days, and she
ventured to ask, “Mother, what has become
of that cousin of father’s, Arthur Sedgewick?
Mrs. Wilson spoke of him to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then try and forget that you ever heard
of him.” Mrs. Sedgewick spoke harshly; she
seemed all at once to freeze up, and Dorothy
knew that she would not dare to speak of him
to her mother again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sighed a little impatiently. Why could
not mothers talk to their daughters with some
show of reasonable equality? She was nearly
a woman; surely her mother might have discussed
that old-time story with her, seeing she
had been compelled to hear of it from an
outsider.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sort of desperation on her that
morning—she did so badly want some sort of
guidance on the subject of her fitness to work
for the Lamb Bursary. Presently she brought
the talk back to the subject of the Bursary.
She described the enrolment ceremony for
her mother’s benefit, and she watched keenly
to see the effect it would produce. She told
how the provisions of the Bursary read that no
girl could be a candidate whose parents had
been in prison; she said no girl might enrol
who knew herself guilty of cheating or stealing.
She waxed really confidential, and told her
mother of one girl whom she had seen stealing
who had yet dared to enrol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was very wrong of her,” said Mrs.
Sedgewick, who was looking rather pale.
“Should you not have told about her,
Dorothy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, mother, I could not! They would have
called me a sneak!” cried Dorothy in distress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, see to it, then, that the girl does not
get a chance of winning the Bursary, or you
will be compounding a felony.” Mrs. Sedgewick
spoke brusquely, so it seemed to Dorothy,
who felt that she could dare no more in the
way of extracting guidance in her present
dilemma. Several times she tried to say,
“Mother, Mrs. Wilson told me about father
having to go to prison—was it true?” but
the words stuck in her throat—they positively
refused to be uttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a doubt of her mother’s sense of
honour crept into her mind. Tom declared
that women had no hard-and-fast standpoints
with regard to honour, and that it was second
nature with them to behave in a way which
would be reckoned downright dishonourable
in a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was it possible Tom was right? Dorothy
set herself to watch her mother very carefully
for the remainder of the vacation; but she got
no satisfaction from the process, except that
of seeing that her mother never once deviated
from the lines of uprightness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was out with her father a great deal
during those holidays. He was old-fashioned
enough to still use a horse and trap for most
of his professional work. Dorothy drove him
on his rounds nearly every day. This should
have been Tom’s work; but Tom was choosing
to be very busy in other directions just then,
and as Dorothy loved to be out with her father,
she was quite ready to overlook Tom’s neglect
of duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never, never did she dare to ask him the
question which she had tried to ask her mother.
She spoke to him of Mrs. Wilson, and although
his face kindled in a gleam of pleasure at hearing
of an old acquaintance, he did not seem to
care to talk about her, or of the part of his life
in which she figured, and again Dorothy was
up against a stone wall in her efforts at further
enlightenment on that grim bit of history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the morning before the two went
back to school, and, as usual, Dorothy was out
with her father, whose round on this particular
day took him to Langbury, where he had to see
a patient who was also an old friend. He was
a long time in that house; but the spring
sunshine was so pleasant that Dorothy did not
mind the waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was sitting with her eyes taking in all
the beauty of the ancient High Street, when a
car came swiftly round the corner, hooting
madly, and missing the doctor’s trap, which
was drawn up on the right side of the road,
only by inches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy heard herself hailed by a familiar
voice, and saw Rhoda Fleming leaning out
and waving wildly to her as the car went down
the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Sedgewick came out at the moment and
stood looking at the fluttering handkerchief
which was being wagged so energetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that some one you know?” he asked.
“Downright road hogs they were, anyhow.
Why, they almost shaved our wheel as they shot
past. It was enough to make a horse bolt. It
is lucky Captain is a quiet animal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The girl who was waving her handkerchief
was Rhoda Fleming, one of the Sixth,
and a candidate for the Lamb Bursary,” said
Dorothy, as she guided Captain round the
narrow streets of Langbury, and so out to the
Farley Road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where does she come from?” asked Dr.
Sedgewick, and he frowned. Rhoda’s face
had been quite clear to him as she was whirled
past in the racing car, and he had been struck
by a something familiar in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her people live at Henlow in Surrey, or
is it Sussex?” said Dorothy. “Her father is
a rather important person, and has twice been
mayor of Henlow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know him—Grimes Fleming his name is—but
I do not know much good about him.”
The doctor spoke rather grimly, then asked,
“Is this girl a great chum of yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly.” Dorothy laughed, thinking
of the openly avowed dislike Rhoda had displayed
for her. “I think Tom and she are
great pals; but I do not know that she is
particularly good for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seeing she is her father’s daughter, I
should say that she is not. Can’t you stop it,
Dorothy?” There was anxiety in her father’s
tone that Dorothy was quick to sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have tried, but Tom won’t listen to me,”
she said in a troubled tone. “He is like that,
you know; to speak against her to him would
only make him the more determined to be
friends with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, Tom is a chip off the old block,
and in more senses than one, I am afraid.” The
doctor sighed heavily, thinking of the abundant
crop of wild oats which he had sown in those
back years. Then he went on, taking her into
confidence, “I am a bit worried about Tom:
he seems to have got a little out of the straight;
there are signs about him of having grown out
of his home. He asked me, too, if I could
not increase his allowance so that he could
spread himself a little for the benefit of his
future.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, father, what did you say to him?”
Dorothy’s tone was shocked. She thought of
all the evidence of sacrifice that she had seen
since she had been at home, and she wondered
where Tom’s eyes were that he had not seen
them too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I laughed at him.” The doctor chuckled,
as if the remembrance was amusing. “I told
him he would best advance his future by sticking
at his work rather tighter, and leave all
ideas of spreading himself out of count until
he was in a position to earn his own living.
Why does he want a girl for a pal? Are there
not enough boys at the Compton School to
meet his requirements?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, lots of the boys and girls are pally. It
is rather looked upon as the right thing in our
little lot; and Rhoda is enough older than Tom
to be of great use in rubbing down his angles,
if she chose to do it,” Dorothy answered, and
her cheeks became more rosy as she thought
of the part she herself had had in putting down
gambling in the boys’ school, by her influence
over Bobby Felmore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph, there is sense in the idea certainly,”
the doctor said. “Of course it depends
for success on what sort of a girl a boy like Tom
gets for a pal. I should not think a daughter
of Grimes Fleming would be good for Tom.
Do what you can to stop it, Dorothy. Remember,
I depend on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear, I am afraid you will be disappointed,
then,” sighed Dorothy. “I do not
seem to have any power at all with Tom. I
am older than he is, but that does not count,
because he says he is the cleverer, as he won
a scholarship for Compton and I did not. I
suppose he is right, too, for he has won his
way where I have had to be paid for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks as if you are going to beat him
now, if you keep on as you have done for the
last two terms,” said her father. “We are
looking to you to win that Lamb Bursary,
Dorothy. You have got to do it, for our sakes
as well as your own. It will mean a tremendous
lot to your mother and me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something that was nearly like a sob came
up in Dorothy’s throat and half-choked her.
She realized that her father was actually pleading
with her not to fail. In the background was
that damaging story told to her by Mrs. Wilson.
Because of that she was in honour bound not
to go in for the Lamb Bursary. What was the
right thing to do? If only—oh! if only she
knew what was the right thing to do!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hard part was that she could find no
help at home, and she had to face going back
to school with her question unsolved.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap19'>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<h3>A SUDDEN RESOLVE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The first three weeks of term slipped away
with little to mark their going. Rhoda
was sweetly polite to Dorothy in public, but on
the rare occasions when the two met with no
one else within sight or hearing, then the ugly
spirit that was in Rhoda came uppermost, and
words of spite slipped off her tongue. It was
almost as if she was daring Dorothy to speak
of that incident which occurred in the showrooms
of Messrs. Sharman and Song. For the
first two weeks Dorothy had been top, but the
third week Rhoda was above her—a fiercely
triumphant Rhoda this time, for it had been a
heavy struggle, and by nature she was not fond
of work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy had not been able to do her best
at work that week; the term was going so
fast—the end was coming nearer and nearer.
She felt she could win the Bursary if only she
could be free in her mind that she had a right
to it. It was the fear in her heart that she was
in honour barred from the right to strive for
it which was doing her work so much harm
just now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mental trouble had to be kept to herself—it
would have done no good to go about wearing
a face as long as a fiddle. This would have
excited comment directly: it would probably
have ended in the doctor being called to see
her, and he would have stopped her work.
Oh no! She had just to wear a smiling face
and carry herself in a care-free manner, taking
her part in every bit of fun and frolic that came
her way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the early mornings that the trouble
hit her hardest. She would wake very early,
when the day was breaking and all the birds
were starting their day with a riot of bird music.
Then she would lie sleepless until the rising-bell
rang, and she would search and grope in
her mind for a way out of the muddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was lying in this fashion one morning
while a cuckoo called outside her window
and a blackbird trilled from the top of an elm
tree growing just outside the lodge gate.
What a cheerful sort of world it was, with only
herself so bothered, so fairly harassed with
care!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly a wild idea flashed into her mind.
She would tell the Head about it, and then the
responsibility would be lifted from her shoulders.
What a comfort it would be to cease from her
blind groping to find a way out!</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Dorothy to resolve was to do. But for
that day at least she had to wait, for the Head
had gone to London on business and did not
return until the last train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a little difficult even for one of the
Sixth to get a private interview with the Head.
Try as she would, Dorothy could not screw her
courage to the point of standing up and asking
for the privilege. In the end she wrote a note
begging that Miss Arden would permit her to
come for a private interview on a matter that
was of great importance to herself. Even when
the letter was written there was the question
of how to get it into the hands of the Head.
But finally she slipped it with the other letters
into the box in the hall, and then prepared to
wait with what patience she could for developments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These were not long in coming. She was
in the study with the others that evening,
and she was trying hard to write a paper on
English literature—a subject that would have
been actually fascinating at any other time—when
Miss Groome, on her way to the staff
sitting-room, put her head in at the door,
saying quietly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dorothy, the Head wants to see you in
her room; you had better go down at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy rose up in her place; her heart was
beating furiously and her senses were in a
whirl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dorothy, what is the matter? Have
you got into a row?” asked Hazel kindly,
while Margaret looked up with such a world
of sympathy in her eyes that Dorothy was
comforted by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m not in a fix of that sort,” she
managed to say, and she smiled as she went
out of the room, though her face was very
pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her limbs shook and her teeth chattered
as she went down the stairs and along the
corridor to the private room of the Head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly chump, pull yourself together!” she
muttered, giving herself a shake; then she
knocked at the door, feeling a wild desire to
run away, now that the interview loomed so
near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in,” said the Head, and Dorothy
opened the door, to find Miss Arden not at the
writing table, which stood in the middle of the
room, but sitting in a low chair by the open
window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy halted just inside the open door;
she was still oppressed by that longing to run
away, to escape from the consequences of her
own act. She looked so shrinking, so downright
afraid, as she stood there, that a grave fear of
serious trouble came into the heart of the Head
as she pointed to another low chair on the other
side of the window, and bade Dorothy sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is such a lovely evening,” she said in
a matter-of-fact voice. “Look through that
break in the trees, Dorothy; you can just see
the sun shining on the sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very pretty,” said Dorothy; then she
sat down suddenly, and was dumbly thankful
for the relief of being able to sit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the trouble?” asked the Head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her manner was so understanding that Dorothy
suddenly lost her desire to run away, the
furious beating of her heart subsided, and she
was able to look up and speak clearly, although
her words came out in a rather incoherent
jumble because of her hurry to get her story
told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not sure that I have any right to keep
trying for the Lamb Bursary—I mean I am by
honour bound to tell you everything, and then
you will decide for me, and tell me what I have
to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that when you enrolled you
kept something back?” asked the Head gravely.
She was thinking this might be a case of having
been unfit at the first, and refusing to own up
to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no,” said Dorothy earnestly. “When
I enrolled I had no idea there was anything
to prevent me from becoming a candidate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it is nothing to do with yourself
personally?” There was a throb of actual relief
in the heart of the Head. She was bound up
in her girls; the disgrace of one of them would
be her own disgrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” Dorothy hesitated a minute; it was
fearfully hard to drag out that story about her
father. She had a vision of his dear careworn
face just then, and it seemed to her a desecration—even
an unfilial thing—to say a thing of
his past which might lower him in the esteem
of the Head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it is not yourself, then at least you could
not help it.” The Head spoke kindly, with a
desire to make Dorothy’s task easier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember the day of the very high
tide, when an accident happened on the front,
and I met a lady, Mrs. Wilson, of Sevenoaks,
who asked me to take tea with her at the Grand,
Ilkestone, next day?” Dorothy spoke in a sort
of desperate burst, anxious to get the story
out as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I remember.” The Head smiled in
a reassuring fashion. “Mrs. Wilson was an
old friend of your father’s, I think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; she used to know him when he was
a medical student. She said that he and his
cousin, Arthur Sedgewick, with two others
named Bagnall, were a very wild lot; they did
all sorts of harum-scarum things. They were
coming home from a dance one night, and father
was driving a cab that was racing another cab.
Father’s cab collided with a police wagonette,
which was badly smashed up, and an old woman
was hurt. For that father had to go to prison
for a fortnight.” It was out now—out with a
vengeance. Dorothy fairly gasped at her own
daring in telling the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Head looked blank. “This was not
pleasant hearing for you, of course. Still, I do
not see how it affects your standing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! don’t you remember the rules that
were read out at the enrolment ceremony?”
cried Dorothy, with a bright spot of pink showing
in both her white cheeks. “It was read out
that no girl was eligible whose parents had at
any time been in prison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course; but I had forgotten.” There
was a shocked note in the tone of the Head,
her eyes grew very troubled, and she sat for
a moment in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment was it? To Dorothy it seemed
more like a year—a whole twelve months—of
strained suffering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dorothy, are you quite sure—quite absolutely
sure—that this is a fact?” Miss Arden
asked, breaking the silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Choking back a sob, Dorothy bowed her
head. Speech was almost impossible just then.
But the Head was waiting for a detailed answer,
and she had to speak. “Mrs. Wilson was there—she
was in the cab—so she must certainly
have known all about it. She told the story to
me as if it were a good joke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been home since then—did you
speak of this to your father and mother?”
The Head was looking so worried, so actually
careworn, that Dorothy suddenly found it easier
to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tried to ask my mother about it, but she
would not discuss it with me.” Dorothy’s
tone became suddenly frigid, as if it had taken
on her mother’s attitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you speak to your father about it?”
The Head was questioning closely now in order
that she might get at the very bottom of the
mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I could not!” There was sharp pain
in Dorothy’s tone; her father was her hero—the
very best and bravest, the very dearest of men.
Something of this she had to make clear to the
Head if she could, and she went on, her voice
breaking a little in spite of her efforts at self-control.
“Daddy is such a dear; he is so hard-working;
he is always sacrificing himself for
some one or doing something to help some
one—I just could not tell him of that awful old
story. He would have felt so bad, too, because
he kept urging me to win the Lamb Bursary if
I could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you tell him of that rule—that stupid,
foolish rule—about no one being eligible whose
parents had been in prison?” asked the Head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy put out her hands as if to ward off
a blow. “Oh, I could not! Why, it would
have broken his heart to think that any action
of his in the past was to bar my way in the
future. I did tell mother about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did she say?” The insistent questioning
of the Head was beginning to get on
Dorothy’s nerves; then, too, it was so unpleasant
to be obliged to own up to the stark truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother said nothing,” she answered dully.
And then the interview became suddenly a long-drawn-out
torture: she was racked and beaten
until she could bear no more, while all the time
she could hear the cynical words of Tom about
woman having no sense of honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps the Head understood something of
what Dorothy was feeling, for her tone was so
very kind and sympathetic when she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we will do nothing in the matter
for a week. I will take that time to think things
round. But, Dorothy, I am very specially
anxious that this talk shall make no difference
to your work or your striving. Go on doing
your very utmost to win the Bursary. I
cannot tell you what a large amount of good
this hard work of the candidates is doing for
the whole school. You are not working merely
to maintain your own position—you are setting
the pace for the others. Don’t worry about
this either. Just put the thought of it away
from your mind. It may be I can find a way
out for you—at least I will try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy rose to her feet. The strain was
over, and, marvel of marvels, she was still
where she had been—at least for another week.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap20'>CHAPTER XX</h1></div>

<h3>PLAYING THE GAME</h3>

<p class='pindent'>It was a wonderful relief to Dorothy to
have her burden of responsibility lifted.
She could give her whole mind to her work
now, without having to suffer from that
miserable see-saw of doubt and fear about her
right to work for the Lamb Bursary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So good was it, too, that she had no longer
to pretend to be cheerful. She could be as
happy as the other girls now, and the week that
followed was one of the happiest she had ever
spent at the Compton School. As was natural,
her work gained a tremendous advantage from
her care-free condition, and when the marks
for the week were posted up on the board she
found that she was top again, a long way ahead
of Rhoda this time, while Hazel and Margaret
were lower still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks—it really does—as if Dorothy
Sedgewick was going to cart off the Mutton
Bone,” said Daisy Goatby with a tremendous
yawn, as she came sauntering up to the board
to have a look at the week’s marks. Dorothy
had already gone upstairs, and for the moment
there was no one in the lecture hall except
Daisy and Joan Fletcher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is one thing to be said for her—she
will have earned it,” answered Joan.
“Dorothy must work like a horse to get in
front of Rhoda—and she hasn’t had Rhoda’s
chances, either, seeing that she only came here
last autumn. I think she is the eighth wonder
of the world. It makes me tired to look at
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t Rhoda just be in a wax when she
sees how much she is down?” Daisy gurgled
into delighted laughter, her plump cheeks
fairly shaking with glee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind what sort of a wax she is in, if
it does not occur to her to coach us into getting
ahead of Dorothy,” said Joan with a yawn.
She was tired, for she had been playing tennis
every available half-hour right through the
day, and felt much more inclined for bed
than for study. But she was in the Sixth—she
was, moreover, a candidate for the Lamb
Bursary—so it was up to her to make a pretence
of study at night, even if the amount done was
not worth talking about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think Rhoda will try that old game
on again—at least I hope she won’t,” said Daisy,
as the two turned away to mount the stairs
to the study. “I never had to work harder
in my life than at that time. I expected to
have nervous breakdown every day, for the
pace was so tremendous. If she had kept it
up, I believe I should have stood a chance of
winning the Mutton Bone—that is to say, if
Dorothy had not been in the running. Rhoda
is a downright good coach; she has a way of
making you work whether you feel like it or
not. The trouble is that she gets tired of it so
soon. She dropped us all in a hurry, just as
I was beginning to feel I had got it in me to
be really great at getting on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know why she dropped us.” Joan shrugged
her shoulders and glanced round in a suddenly
furtive fashion, as the two went side by side
up the broad stairs, and the June sunshine
streamed in through the open windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” sharply demanded Daisy, scenting
a mystery, and keen to hear what it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell you now,” said Joan hastily.
“I am afraid some one might catch a word,
and it is serious. I’ll tell you to-morrow when
we are resting after a bout of tennis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow? Do you think I am going
to wait until then? Come along into the prep
room—the Upper Fifth are not at work to-night.
See, there is no one here. We will sit
over by the window, then only the sparrows
can hear what you have to say. Now, then,
out with it; I hate to wait for anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rhoda had to leave off using cribs—that
is why she left off coaching us,” said Joan,
jerking her shoulders up in a way peculiar to
her in moments of triumphant emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cribs wouldn’t be of much use in a good
bit of our work,” said Daisy scornfully. “For
instance, what sort of a crib could you use to
remember one of old Plimsoll’s lectures?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be an idiot,” snapped Joan. “There
are plenty of things we have to do where cribs
would be useful—Latin, French, mathematics—oh!
heaps of things. It was Rhoda who had
that old book of Amelia Herschstein’s that was
found in the No. 1 study among Dorothy’s
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was quite sure of that.” Daisy nodded and
chuckled in delight. “I was not quite so fast
asleep as I was supposed to be that night, and
I knew that Rhoda had been out of the room,
although she did go and come like a cat.
But what I want to know is what made her
have Amelia Herschstein’s book in her possession.
Did she find it anywhere about the
premises, do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, in the name of common sense is it
likely that a book of that sort would be left
lying round for any girl to pick up and use
if she felt so inclined?” Joan fairly snorted
with disgust at Daisy’s want of understanding.
“That book was in the school because Rhoda
brought it here. I never could imagine why
she chose to stuff it among Dorothy’s things,
except from blind spite, because, of course,
she has had to work much harder since she
has had to do without its help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy looked the picture of bewilderment.
“How did it come about that she had the book
at all?” she gasped, staring open-mouthed at
Joan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! do you know what I found out last
vac?” Joan pursed up her mouth in a secretive
fashion. She nodded her head, and looked wise,
and so smug with it all, that Daisy forgot the
dignity due in one of the Sixth, and actually
fell upon her, cuffing her smartly, while she
cried, “Out with it, then, or I will bang your
head against the window-frame until you see
stars and all that sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t behave like a Third Form kid if
you can help it, and, for pity’s sake, don’t make
such a noise, or some one will spot us, and then
we shall get beans for not being at work,”
protested Joan, wresting herself free from the
rough grip of Daisy, and patting her hair into
place. Joan was beginning to revel in being
nearly grown-up, and she was very particular
about her hair being just right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, tell me quickly!” said Daisy,
with a stamp of her foot. “If you don’t,
I will ruff your hair all up until it is in a most
fearful tangle, and I will throw your ribbon,
your combs, and those lovely tortoise-shell pins
all out of the window. A nice sight you will
look then, old thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And nice beans, a regular boiling of them,
you would get for doing it,” laughed Joan,
who loved to tease Daisy into an exhibition
of this sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, tell me!” cried Daisy, with another
stamp of her foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father told me,” said Joan, nodding
her head. “He said that Grimes Fleming—Rhoda’s
father, you know—was closely related
to the Herschsteins. It has been kept very
dark, because, of course, no one in any way
connected with that family would have been
received at the Compton Schools if it had been
known. Dad would not have told me about
it if I had not insisted that this floor was
haunted by Amelia’s ghost, and that the spirit
actually left books in the studies. I thought
my dad would have had a fit then, he was so
choked with laughing. That is when he told
me, and he said I was to keep it dark, for it
did not seem fair that Rhoda should have the
sins of those who went before fastened on her
shoulders to weigh her down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t playing the game, though, to let
a girl like that win the Lamb Bursary,” said
Daisy in a tone that was fairly shocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what I said to my dad. But he told
me it was up to me to stop her doing it by
jolly well beating her myself. I think I would
have a real vigorous try to do it, too, if it
were not for Dorothy. I might beat Rhoda
if I tried hard enough, and kept on trying.
Dorothy is a different matter; she is forcing
the pace so terribly that I can’t face the fag of
it all. Rhoda would not put out her strength
as she does if it were not for her spite against
Dorothy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why does she hate Dorothy so badly?”
asked Daisy, whose excitement had subsided,
leaving her more serious than usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask me another,” said Joan, flinging up
her hands with a gesture that was meant to be
dramatic. “I think it would need a Sherlock
Holmes to find that out. I have pumped her—I
have watched her—but I am no nearer getting
to the bottom of it. It is my belief that
Dorothy knows something about Rhoda, and
Rhoda knows she knows it. Oh dear, what a
mix up of words, but you know what I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think she ought to be allowed to win
the Lamb Bursary—it was not meant for a girl
of that sort.” Daisy sounded reproachful now,
for it did seem a shame that the chief prize of
the school should go to one who was unworthy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joan wagged her head with a knowing air.
“I know how you feel, for it is just my opinion.
I am keeping quiet now, as I promised my dad
I would. If Dorothy or Hazel or any one else
wins the Bursary, then there will be no need
to say anything at all; but if Miss Rhoda comes
out top, then I am going to say things, and do
things, and stir up no end of a dust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this moment that two of the Upper
Fifth came scurrying up to their prep room,
and the two who had been talking there had
to get out in a hurry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda was carrying things before her in
the Sixth. She had contrived to chum up a
great deal with Dora Selwyn, who by reason
of being head girl was a power in the place.
Dora was rarely top of the school in the matter
of marks; the fact that she was specializing
naturally tended to keep these down. But in
every other sense she was top, and she was
leader—in short, she was <span class='sc'>it</span>, and every one
realized this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dora had fallen foul of Rhoda a good many
times during the years they had both been at
the Compton School, but they had seemed to
get on better of late. Right down at the bottom
Dora was fearfully conservative. To her way
of thinking it was quite wrong that a new girl
like Dorothy Sedgewick should have been put
straight into the Sixth. It was, in fact, a tacit
admission that education in another school
might be as good as it was at the Compton
Schools—a rank heresy, indeed! Dora would
have got over that in time, perhaps, if Dorothy
had been something of a slacker; but it did not
please her that the new girl—that is to say,
the comparatively new girl—should be mounting
to the top of the school in the matter of
marks week by week, so she veered round to
the side of Rhoda and championed her cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The days simply flew now. The summer
term was always delightful at Sowergate. There
was sea-bathing; there was tennis and golf;
frequent picnics livened things up for all who
cared for that sort of thing; there were bicycle
trips; some of the girls were learning to
ride; two were having motor lessons—so that,
taken all round, every one was so full of affairs
that each night as it came was something of
a surprise, because it had arrived so speedily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy seemed to live only for the end of
the week, when the Head was to give her decision.
In some ways it was the longest week
she had ever lived through; in many other
ways it was so short that Dorothy felt fairly
frightened by the speed with which it went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was evening again when she was summoned
to the private room of the Head, and she rose
up in her place to obey the call, feeling as if she
were going to the place of execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dorothy dear, I am so sorry for you!”
murmured Margaret, jumping up to give her
a hug as she went out of the room, while Hazel
nodded in sympathy, and Jessie Wayne from
the far corner blew her a kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was good to feel that she had the sympathy
of them all, but a wry little smile curved
Dorothy’s lips as she went downstairs. She
was thinking how they would all have stared if
she could have told them what was the matter—and
then, indeed, they would have been sorry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was sorry for herself, except when she
thought of her father; and then, in her pain for
him, she forgot to suffer on her own account.</p>

<h3>THE HEAD DECIDES</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Arden was writing at the table
in the middle of the room when Dorothy
entered. She looked up and motioned to a
low chair near the window. “Sit there for
a few minutes, Dorothy; I shall not be long
before I am free to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy sat down, and instinctively her
glance went out to that bit of shining sea
visible through the gap in the trees, which the
Head had pointed out to her a week ago.
It was an evening just like that one had been,
with the sun shining on the water, and the
trees so still that they did not sway across that
little patch of brightness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the Head finished writing, rang the
bell for the letters to be taken away for posting,
and then, leaving her writing table, came over
to sit by Dorothy at the open window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How has your work gone this week?”
she asked a little abruptly. Then, seeing that
Dorothy seemed puzzled, she went on speaking
in her crisp tones, “I was not asking in reference
to your school position—I know all about
that. I wanted to know how you had felt about
your work, and whether it was easier because
of our talk last week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy’s face flashed into smiles, and she
answered eagerly, “Oh, it was much easier,
thank you. I have had no worry of responsibility,
you see. I have been free to keep on
working without any wonder as to whether I
had the right to work in that special way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Head nodded in sympathetic fashion,
and was silent for a few minutes, as if she were
still considering that decision of hers; then she
asked, “Are you willing to trust the responsibility
to me for the rest of the term?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy looked blank. “I don’t think I
quite understand,” she said. “It is for you
to decide what I have to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Head laughed, then flung out her hands
with a little gesture of helplessness as she
answered, “I know the decision rests with me.
The trouble is that I cannot at the present
see any light on the situation. Until that
comes you have just to go on as you are doing
now. You have to make the very bravest fight
you can. You have to work and to struggle—to
do your very best; and having done this,
you have to wait in patience for the issue of it
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can do that, of course,” said Dorothy;
but her tone was a little doubtful—it was even
a little disappointed. It was a hard-and-fast
decision she craved: a pronouncement that
could not be set aside—which put an end to
hope and fear, and that left her nothing to be
anxious about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to do it, feeling that it is the
best—and, indeed, the only way.” The Head
spoke with a slow deliberation which carried
weight. “You see, Dorothy, you have to think
not merely of yourself and your own sense of
honour, which is a very fine one; but you have
to think also of your father and the effect it
might have on him and his career if you withdrew
from your position as a candidate now.
You know very well how serious it is for a
doctor to be talked about in such a way as
would inevitably occur if this story became
common property. A doctor smirched is a
doctor destroyed. We have to be very careful
on his account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know; I had thought about that,” said
Dorothy in a curiously muffled tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is good. Your consideration for
him will help you more than anything else.”
The Head smiled with such kindly approval
that Dorothy was thrilled. “I am not even
going to suggest that you may not win the
Lamb Bursary; to fail in doing that, through
any lack of striving on your part, would be
the coward’s way out of a difficulty, and that
could never be the right way. Your chance
of winning is very good. Rhoda Fleming is
your most serious rival. In some ways she
has the advantage, because she has been here
so much longer that she has been better
grounded on our lines of work. On the other
hand, you have an advantage over her of steadier
application. You keep on keeping on, where
she goes slack, and has to pull herself up with
extra effort. This may succeed where the
struggle is a short one, but will not be of much
use in a long strain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t work by starts like that,” said
Dorothy. “I should soon get left if I did
not keep straight on doing my utmost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the only way to real success,” the Head
remarked thoughtfully. Then she went on,
hesitating a little now, picking her words very
carefully, “In the event of your winning,
then I should think it best to call the governors
of the Bursary together, and make a plain statement
of the case to them. If they decided
that you were unfit to receive the benefit of
the Bursary, the matter could be kept from
becoming public. The story about your father
need never leak out, and although he would
have the pain of knowing all about it, the
outside world would not be any the wiser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! it would hurt him so dreadfully to
know it was his action which had shut me out
from the chance of a university training!”
cried Dorothy, shrinking as if the Head had dealt
her a blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, dear, and it is painful even to think
about it. But the governors, taking all things
into consideration, may even decide to let you
take it, in which case your father may be spared
ever hearing of the affair. I cannot think why
such a strange provision was put into the rules
for enrolment. It might have been that poor
Miss Lamb had been compelled to suffer in
her time at the hands of some girl whose
parent, one or the other, had been in prison,
and so it was a case of avenging herself at the
expense of the girls who might come after her.
Such things do happen. Then, too, it is not
as if your father had been in prison from any
deliberate attempt at law-breaking. If he had
embezzled money—if he had set himself up
against what was right and honourable—it
would have been a different matter. I think
the punishment was far in excess of the wrong-doing,
which appears to have begun and ended
in an outburst of larkiness and high spirits;
but I suppose it was the old woman being hurt
which caused the sentence to be imprisonment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would the governors have the power to
set aside that old rule?” asked Dorothy,
whose eyes had brightened with a sudden
stirring of hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fancy the governors have all power to
do as seems wisest to them,” the Head replied;
and then she said, with a low laugh, “As they
are men, it would be no question of their sense
of honour being shaky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy gave a start of pure amazement at
such an utterance from the Head; she was even
bold enough to ask, “Do you think that women
are less honourable than men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, that is a rather difficult question
to answer,” replied the Head. “Taken in
the broadest sense, I should be inclined to
think that the great mass of women are less
honourable than men. But that is the result
of long ages of being regarded as irresponsible
beings—the mere appendage or chattel of man—with
no moral standing of their own. Taken
in the individual sense, I believe that when a
woman or a girl is honourable, she is far more
so than a man—that is to say, she would be
honourable down to the last shred of detail,
while a man under like conditions would be
honourable in the bulk, but absolutely careless
of the smaller details. That is largely theory,
however, and does not concern the present
business in the least. We have talked about
it enough, too, and now we will leave it alone.
I do not forget—and I am sure the governors
will not forget—that you, of your own free
will, came to me with this uncomfortable fact
from your father’s past, and that you offered
to withdraw, or to do anything else which I
might decide was best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy rose to go. There was one question
she had to ask, a fearfully difficult one, but she
screwed her courage to the attempt. “Supposing
I came out top in the running for the
Bursary, but the governors decided I might
not take it, would they give the Bursary to the
girl who was next below me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Head looked thoughtful—she even hesitated
before replying; then she said slowly,
“I do not know. I do not think such a case as
this has ever arisen before. They might even
decide not to give the Bursary at all this year.
Why did you ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hot colour flamed over Dorothy’s face,
it mounted to the roots of her hair, she was
suddenly the picture of confusion, and stammered
out the first answer which came into
her head, “I—I just wanted to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dorothy, what is it that you know against
Rhoda Fleming, which would put her out of
the running for the Bursary if you told?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice of the Head was so quiet, so curiously
level, that for a moment Dorothy did
not grasp the full significance of the question.
Then it flashed upon her that she held Rhoda
in her hand, and, with Rhoda, her own sense
of honour also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I could not tell you—I could not. I
beg of you do not ask me,” she cried, stretching
out her hands imploringly, then questioned
eagerly, “How did you even guess there was
anything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way Rhoda has treated you all the
term; but I could not be sure until I had asked
you a point-blank question at a moment when
you were not expecting it,” replied the Head;
and then she said kindly, “Why can you not
trust me with your knowledge, Dorothy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colour faded from Dorothy’s face. She
was white and spent; indeed, she looked as if
tears were not far away as she stood with her
back to the door and the strong light of the
sunset full on her face. “The knowledge
I have came to me without my seeking,” she
said in a low tone. “I have no means of
proving what I know, and if I told you it would
seem like taking a dishonourable way of downing
a rival in work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand that,” said the Head. “Why
did you ask me about Rhoda, if she would have
the Bursary if you were not allowed to keep it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy moved uneasily. Her tongue felt
so parched that speech was difficult; then she
said in a low tone, “I spoke to my mother
when I was at home, without, of course, giving
her facts or names, and I asked her what I
ought to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did she say?” The Head was
smiling, and Dorothy took heart again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother told me to make such an effort
to win the Bursary for myself, that it would
not matter in the end whether the girl was fit
or unfit to have enrolled as a candidate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good advice, too. But I see your
position again. If you speak you let your
rival down; from your point of view, it would
not be playing the game. If you keep silent,
and win the Bursary, but yet because of this
story of your father’s past you are passed over
and it is given to Rhoda, the irony of the situation
will be fairly crushing.” The Head was
looking at Dorothy with great kindness in her
manner, and Dorothy was comforted because
she was understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not force me to speak?” she
asked, greatly daring, for the Head was by no
means a person to be trifled with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I will even admire you for your desire
not to do so, though it makes me feel as if I
were compounding a felony.” The Head laughed
as she spoke; then, becoming suddenly grave,
she went on, “If it should turn out that you
win the Bursary, and the governors will not
let you take it, I shall require of you that you
tell me and tell them of this thing you are
keeping to yourself. The honour of the school
demands this at your hands. It is not fair
that the Lamb Bursary should go to a girl who
has won it by a trick or by any keeping back
of that which should be known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it is not fair,” admitted Dorothy, and
a dreadful dismay filled her heart to think that
she might have to tell of what she had seen in
the showroom of Messrs. Sharman and Song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, and now let us leave all these
problems for the future to solve,” said the Head,
holding out a slim white hand for Dorothy to
shake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a wave of gratitude flowed into the
heart of Dorothy, to think she had not to betray
Rhoda, that, yielding to impulse, she carried that
slim white hand to her lips, kissing it in the
ardour of her devotion and admiration. Then
she went out of the room with her head carried
high, and such a feeling of elation in her heart
that it was difficult to refrain from dancing a jig
on the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dorothy, you are a fraud!” cried Hazel,
as Dorothy came into the study, smiling, radiantly
happy, and looking as if it were morning
instead of nearly bedtime. “Here have Margaret
and I been snivelling in sympathy with
you, because we thought you were having a
ragging from the Head for some misdemeanour
or other, instead of which you come prancing
upstairs as if the whole place belonged to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is how I feel,” said Dorothy blithely.
“The Head—bless her—has not been ragging
me; she has only been laying down rules for
my conduct in future, and that, you know, is
why we come to school, to be taught what we
do not know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks as if you are having us on,”
said Margaret, glancing up from her work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, we will go to bed now, and
sleep it off,” answered Dorothy, and then would
say no more.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap22'>CHAPTER XXII</h1></div>

<h3>THE STRUGGLE FOR THE CUP</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Just below the stained-glass window which
was at the back of the dais in the lecture
hall stood a silver cup of great beauty.
Other and lesser cups were ranged on each
side of it, and all of them were protected by
a glass case of heavy make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This principal cup had been in the girls’
school for two years now. It had to be fought
for on the tennis courts each year at the end
of the summer term. Until two years ago
the boys had won it for six or seven years in
succession, and great had been the jubilation
among the girls when at last they had succeeded
in winning it for themselves. Having
had it for two years, they were preparing to
fight for it again with might and main when
the time for the struggle should come round
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Realizing that the best players were not
always to be found in the Sixth Form, the
contest was fought by the united efforts of the
Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Forms, the finals
being fought amid scenes of the wildest
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The struggle was fixed for just one week
before the end of term, and was indeed the
beginning of the end—the first break of the
steady routine of the past three months.
Fortunately the weather was all that could be
desired, and every one was in wild spirits for
the fray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fourth and the Fifth of both schools
were early on the ground. The excitement at
the courts was tremendous. Exasperated by
having lost the cup for two years in succession,
the boys had been working hard at tennis this
summer, and they were out to win—a fact
the girls were quick to realize.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The games had already started when the
Sixth of the boys’ school came pouring out
from their school premises across the cricket
field to the courts of the girls’ school, where
the battle was being fought. Two minutes
later the girls of the Sixth also arrived on the
scene. They were a little late because of a
history exam which had held them until the
last minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The governors of the schools left nothing
to chance, and the exams of the last two weeks
of the summer term were things of magnitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy came down to the courts with Joan
Fletcher. Hazel and Margaret, her special
chums, were in front, but Dorothy had been
delayed by Miss Groome, and was the last on
the scene—or would have been if Joan had not
waited for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a jolly old day it is!” exclaimed
Joan, anxious to show a friendly front. Both
she and Daisy Goatby had completely veered
round in these last weeks, and showed themselves
very anxious to be on friendly terms with
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it could not be better!” Dorothy
flourished her racket, and executed a festive
skip as she hurried along. “It is just perfect
weather for tennis, and I think—I really think
we shall beat the boys if we play hard enough.
And oh! we must keep that cup if we can, for
the honour of the school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a lot you think of honour.” Joan
half turned as she hurried along, and she
surveyed Dorothy closely, as if trying to find
out what made her so keen on upholding the
traditions of the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course! But that is only right
and natural. Don’t you think so?” There was
surprise in Dorothy’s tone, for Joan seemed
to be hinting at something. Her scurrying run
had dropped to a walk, and Dorothy slowed
up also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t what I think that matters very
much in this case,” burst out Joan explosively.
“I was only thinking what a pity it is that
some of the rest of our crowd are not as keen
on the honour of the school as you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, just what do you mean by that?”
Dorothy halted abruptly, staring at Joan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were just at the edge of the nearest
court now, and the shouts and yells from boys
and girls resounded on all sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joan looked up at the sky, she looked down at
her white tennis shoes, and then her gaze went
wandering as if she were in search of inspiration.
Finally she burst out, “I hate to have
to tell you, but Daisy and I tossed up as to
which should do it, and I am the unlucky one:
your brother has mixed himself up in a particularly
beastly sort of scrape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom is in a scrape?” breathed Dorothy,
and suddenly she felt as if it were her fault,
for she had seen so little of Tom this term, and
when she had seen him he had not cared to
be in any way confidential.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joan nodded in an emphatic fashion. “A
silly noodle he must be to be cat’s-paw for a
girl in such a silly way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has he done?” asked Dorothy,
striving to keep calm and quiet, yet feeling a
wild desire to seize and shake the information
out of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know the real rights of it,” said
Joan. “I know a little, and guess a lot more.
Rhoda has dropped quite a considerable lot
of money lately in hospital raffles and in the
sweepstakes that were got up to provide that
new wing for the infirmary. As she has helped
Tom to so many plums in the way of winning
money in the past, it was only natural that she
turned to him when she got into a muddle
herself. She was in a rather extra special
muddle, too, for she was holding the money we
raised for the archery club, and when the time
came to pay it over, lo! it was not, for she
had spent it, and her dump from home had
not arrived. To tide her over the bad bit she
applied to Tom. He said he had no money,
and did not know where to get it. She, in
desperation—and Rhoda knows how to scratch
when she is in a corner—wrote to Tom that if
the money was not forthcoming in twenty-four
hours, she would tell his Head of the
doings at the night-club.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What night-club?” demanded Dorothy,
aghast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know. Boys are in mischief all
the time, I think,” said Joan impatiently; and
then she went on, “The time-limit passed;
Rhoda got still more desperate and still more
catty. Finding Tom did not pay up—did not
even send to plead for longer time, or take any
other notice of her ultimatum—Rhoda wrote her
letter to Tom’s Head, and actually posted it.
This letter had not been in the post half an
hour when her money from home arrived.
She was able to get out of her fix, but she was
not able to stop having got Tom into an awful
sort of row. And now she is so mad with herself,
that the Compton School is not big enough
to hold her in any sort of comfort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This night-club, what is it exactly?”
Dorothy turned her back on the tennis players,
and faced Joan with devouring anxiety in her
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know really; I think it is got up by
some of the young officers at the camp. Lots
of them are Compton old boys, you know.
I think they meet somewhere at dead of night
to drink and play cards, and go on the burst
generally. They call it going the pace. I
suppose they let some of our boys in for old
sake’s sake, though it would be kinder to the
boys if they did not. Anyhow, it is all out now.
The boys will get in a row, the young officers
may get court-martialled, or whatever they
do with them up there, and all because a girl
lost her temper through not being able to twist
Tom round her little finger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joan, I am ever so grateful to you for telling
me all this, even though I can’t see any way of
helping Tom,” said Dorothy; and then she
asked, “Does he know that Rhoda has told
Dr. Cameron?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did not. The letter did not go until
yesterday, you see,” replied Joan. “The
trouble for Tom will be that he will not only
get beans from the authorities, but the boys
will cut him dead for having been such a
donkey as to trust a girl with a secret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why a girl should not be trusted
as well as a boy,” said Dorothy, who always
felt resentful at this implied inferiority of her
sex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may not see it, but your blindness does
not alter the fact,” said Joan bluntly. “There
goes Rhoda, holding up her head with the best
because she can pay up the money she copped
to pay for her old raffles. I wonder how she
feels underneath, when she thinks how her
letter to Tom’s Head will make history for
the Compton Boys’ School, and for the camp
as well? You see, she has let the whole
lot into it, and there will be no end of a
dust up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even scavengers have their uses,” said
Dorothy, feeling suddenly better because she
realized that Tom would have entirely lost
faith in Rhoda; and although he might have to
suffer many things at the hands of his outraged
companions, he would learn wisdom from the
experience, and come out of the ordeal stronger
all round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is our turn—come along,” cried Joan
with an air of relief. She was thankful indeed
to have got her unpleasant task over,
and to find that Dorothy did not look unduly
upset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The struggle for the cup was being put
through amid displays of wild enthusiasm.
The first sets were played by boys against
boys, and girls against girls, and the yelling
grew fairly frantic when the semi-finals were
reached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls for the semi-final were Dora
Selwyn and Rhoda against Dorothy and a
Fifth Form girl, Milly Stokes, who had carried
all before her in previous sets, though
she was small, and younger than most of her
Form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was rather hard for Dorothy to have to
play against Dora and Rhoda, and she had
little hope of surviving for the final. Rhoda
was a good all-round player; she was great,
too, at smashing and volleying; while Dora,
with no great pace in her strokes, was very
accurate, and always inclined to play for safety
first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no holding Milly Stokes. She
behaved like one possessed. She sent the balls
flying with a reckless abandon which looked
as if it must spell ruin, yet each time made for
success. Dorothy was wrought up to a great
pitch. It was not tennis she seemed to be
playing; it was the contest between right and
wrong—she and Milly Stokes pitted against
Rhoda and the head girl. She was not nervous.
That story of Tom’s impending disgrace had
so absorbed her that she could not think about
herself at all. She was standing for what was
upright and ennobling, so she must play the
game to win.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louder and louder grew the cheering; now
she could hear the shouting for “Little Stokes”
and “Sedgewick of the Sixth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had won, too, and now Milly Stokes
rushed at her, flinging a pair of clinging arms
round her, and crying, “Oh, Dorothy, Dorothy,
you are a partner worth having! We
have beaten those two smashers, and surely,
surely we can beat the boys!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will have a good try, anyhow,” answered
Dorothy with a laugh; and then she
went off to the little pavilion to have a brief
rest while the boys played their last set for
semi-final.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far she had not caught a glimpse of Tom,
but as she came out of the pavilion with Milly
Stokes and went across the court to her place,
she saw him standing by the side of Bobby
Felmore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her heart beat a little faster at this sight.
She knew that he and Bobby had not been on
good terms lately; that they should be together
now, made her jump to the conclusion that
Tom’s punishment at the hands of the boys
had begun, and Bobby was proving something
of a refuge for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you, Bobby!” she murmured under
her breath as she nodded in their direction;
and she was very glad to think that Bobby had
not survived to the final, so that she would not
have to beat him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their opponents were a long, sandy-haired
youth, perspiring freely, and a dark boy of
uncertain temper and play to match. It was
a fine struggle. Milly dashed about more
wildly than ever, but Dorothy played with a
gay unconcern that surprised even herself.
She had vanquished the wrong in the semi-final,
and this last bit of struggle was merely
for the glory of the school. They won, too,
and the shrill cheering of the girls frightened
the birds from the trees, while the boys booed
with a sound of malice in their tone, which was
partly for the loss of the cup, but still more for
the loss of the dubious privilege of their night-club.</p>

<h3>TROUBLE FOR TOM</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy and Milly Stokes were chaired
round the courts by ardent admirers,
and they were cheered until their heads ached
from the noise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as Dorothy could escape she went in
search of Tom. It was some time before she
could find him; and when she did run him
down he was in a temper that was anything but
sweet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom! I am so sorry for the trouble,”
she burst out with ready sympathy. Tom
usually wore such a happy face, that it was just
dreadful to see him looking so glum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is pretty rotten,” he growled. “We are
to be hauled up before the Head in the morning,
and goodness knows what will happen then.
There is one comfort—I am not the only one
in the soup; there are about twenty-five of us
involved. The thing that passes my comprehension
is how it all came out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know?” gasped Dorothy, so
amazed at his words that she had no time to
think of being discreet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should I know?” he said blankly.
“Why, you might have knocked me down with
a feather when Clarges Major told me we’d
been spotted, and that the game was up so
far as our night-club was concerned. It has
been such a jolly lark, too! We used to go
about three nights a week, and get back about
three o’clock in the morning. Some club it
was, too, I can tell you! Say, Dorothy, how
did you know anything about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joan Fletcher told me. She told me how
Rhoda had written all about the club to your
Head, because you would not lend her the
money when she was in a hole about the
archery club subscriptions.” Dorothy spoke
in a quiet tone; she was determined that Tom
should know the true facts of the case. But
she quailed a little when he turned upon her
with fury in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rhoda told because I would not lend her
the money! What on earth are you driving
at? That time when she talked to me about
being so short, I told her then that I was in the
same boat—absolutely stoney.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was because you did not answer her
letter, when she gave you twenty-four hours
to find some money to help her out of her
fix.” Dorothy stopped suddenly because of
the surprise in Tom’s face. “Didn’t you have
that letter?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never set eyes on it,” he answered.
“When did she send it, and how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” answered Dorothy. “Joan
told me that Rhoda was so angry and so very
desperate because you did not answer her
letter, that, to pay you out for leaving her in the
lurch, she wrote a letter to Dr. Cameron, telling
him about the night-club. A little after her
letter went she got the money she wanted from
home, and she would have recalled her letter
to your Head then if she had been able to do it,
but, of course, it was too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The insufferable little cad, to blow on us
like that out of sheer cattish spite!” growled
Tom. Then he asked, with sharp anxiety in
his tone, “Has it leaked out yet among our
crowd that Rhoda told?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid so,” answered Dorothy, and again
she quailed at the look in his eyes. “Didn’t
you hear all the booing when we won the cup?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. I booed myself with might
and main; but that was only because we had
lost it,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy shook her head. “I am afraid it
is more than that—there was such a lot of
malice in the noise. Hazel told me that some
one threw a bag of flour at Rhoda, and written
across the bag were the words ‘For a sneak’;
so it looks as if they knew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that is the case, you bet I am in for it
right up to my back teeth,” growled Tom;
and turning he walked away with never another
word to Dorothy, who reflected sorrowfully
that he was much more concerned at the prospect
of losing the goodwill of his fellows than
because he was implicated in such a serious
breach of rules and regulations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy did not see him again that day. She
did not see him on the next day either; but
rumours were rife in the girls’ school that the
boys involved in the night-club business were
in for a row of magnitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work of the week was so exacting and
absorbing that Dorothy found herself with but
little time for thinking of Tom and his troubles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Sunday—the last Sunday of term it was—Tom
appeared with the other boys in the
gardens of the girls’ school; but he looked so
miserable that Dorothy had a sudden, sharp
anxiety about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom, what is it?” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know?” he said, looking at her
with tragic eyes. “The Head has sent for
the governor, and I don’t feel as if I could
face him when he comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the governor?” echoed Dorothy
blankly, and in the eyes of her mind she was
seeing those grave frock-coated gentlemen who
had sat on the dais in the lecture hall that
day last autumn, at the enrolment of the candidates
for the Lamb Bursary. She wondered
why Dr. Cameron had thought it necessary to
send for one of the school governors about a
case of school discipline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, I mean, and he is coming to-morrow.”
Tom spoke impatiently, for he thought
Dorothy was much more thick in the head than
she ought to have been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father coming to-morrow?” Dorothy’s
voice rose in a shout of sheer ecstasy. “Why,
Tom, we will make him stay over Wednesday,
and then he will be present when the Bursary
winner is declared!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had she uttered that joyful exclamation
than a cold chill crept into her heart.
How dreadful for her father to be present if
she had really won the Mutton Bone; for he
would have to be told perhaps that she could
not be allowed to keep it because of that ugly
fact of his past, which had landed him in
prison for fourteen days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a shame that there should be any
clouds to mar his coming—and it was really a
cloud of an extra heavy sort that was the reason
of his being obliged to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is pretty rotten that he should have been
sent for,” growled Tom. “All the fathers have
been asked to come. So you see Rhoda raised
a pretty heavy dust when she butted in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why have they all been sent for?” asked
Dorothy in dismay. To her way of thinking
such extreme measures boded very ill for the
culprits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fathers and the masters are going to
confer as to what is to be done with us,” explained
Tom, who was leaning against a tree
and moodily kicking at the turf. “Dr. Cameron
has got a bee in his bonnet about the
gambling stunt going on in the schools; he is
making a bid to wipe it out for always—don’t
you wish he may do it? He thinks the best
way is to let our governors take a hand in the
business. He told us that if it had only been
a question of our sneaking out of dorm when
we were supposed to be fast asleep in bed, he
would have dealt with the matter himself, and
taken care that we had so much work to do
that we would be thankful to stay in bed when
we had a chance to get there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom, how I wish you had never given
way to betting and that sort of thing!” cried
Dorothy, dismayed at the turn things had taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to be more sorry still if I have
to lose the scholarship,” said Tom with a
savage air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t—it surely won’t come to that!”
said Dorothy in dismay. Again a pang smote
her as she thought of the double trouble there
might be in store for the dear father. It did
not even comfort her at the moment to remember
how wholly innocent she was of any
hand in bringing on the trouble which might
arise on her account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may do.” Tom’s tone was gloomy in
the extreme. “On the other hand, it may
tell in my favour that I am a scholarship boy.
The authorities may argue that there must be
good in me because I have worked so well in
the past. They will say that, as I am one of
the youngest of the crowd, I was doubtless
led away by the seniors. Oh, there is certain
to be a way out for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not sure that you deserve to have a
way out found for you,” she said severely.
“Oh, Tom, how could you bring such trouble
on them at home!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t preach,” burst out Tom impatiently.
“I get more than enough of that from Bobby
Felmore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby wasn’t in with the night-club
crowd?” questioned Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not he.” Tom snorted in derision of
Bobby and Bobby’s standpoints. “He is too
smug for anything these days. Downright
putrid, I call it. I’ve no use for mugs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here comes Rhoda!” cried Dorothy with
a little gasp of fright. “Oh, Tom, what are
you going to say to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” he answered with a snarl. “If
she were a boy I would fight her. Seeing she
is a girl, I can’t do that; so the only thing to
be done is to look right through her and out
the other side without taking any further notice
of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda bore down upon them with a little
rush, her hands held out in imploring fashion.
“Oh, Tom,” she cried, “I am thankful to
see you here! Why have you not answered
my letters? I have fairly squirmed in the
dust at your feet, begging forgiveness for my
cattish temper. But I was fairly desperate, or
I should never have been so mad as to let you
down, and your crowd as well. Words won’t
say how sorry I am——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She broke off with a jerk, for Tom, after
looking at her with a cold and steady stare,
turned on his heel and walked away, calling
over his shoulder as he went,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long, Dorothy, old girl; see you later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Rhoda stood staring at Tom’s
retreating figure as if she could not believe her
eyes, then she turned upon Dorothy with fury
in her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is your work, then?” she cried
shrilly. “I always knew you were jealous because
Tom thought so much of me. A fine
underhand piece of work, to try and separate
me from my friend!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not tried to separate you from Tom;
it would not have been any use,” said Dorothy
calmly. “The separating, as you call it, was
your own work. Tom will have to bear such
a lot from his crowd because of your letter to
his Head that he says he will not speak to you
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he will come round,” Rhoda said, and
tried to believe it; but she was hurt in her
pride—the more so because she had the sense
to see that she had brought the whole disaster
on herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy turned away. She was feeling
pretty sore herself because of the trouble that
was bringing her father to the Compton Schools
just then. It took away all her joy at the prospect
of seeing him, to think how he might have
to suffer on her account before he went away.
She could not even comfort herself with the
thought that she might not win the Bursary,
because if she did not win it herself, the probabilities
were that Rhoda would win it, in which
case she was pledged to the Head to reveal
that thing against Rhoda which she had seen in
the showrooms of Messrs. Sharman and Song.
What a miserable tangle it all was, and what a
shame that people could not be happy when
they so badly wanted to be free from care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monday came with hours of examination
work. Happily, she was so absorbed in it that
she hardly noticed how the hours went by.
There was an archery contest in the afternoon.
The younger boys came over, and some of the
seniors, but there were big gaps in the Fifth
and the Sixth of the boys’ school. None of
the luckless twenty-five were present, they
being gated for that day and the next—that is
to say, until the council of fathers and masters
had determined on what to do with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy guessed that she would not see her
father that day. Tom had told her he would
reach Sowergate by the six-thirty train, and
as he would go straight to the boys’ school to
dine with Dr. Cameron, and would have to
be at the council afterwards, there would be no
chance of seeing him until next morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard the train run in to Sowergate
station, and there was a thrill in her heart to
think of her father being so near. The worst
of it was that she felt so bad on his account,
because of what he would have to face both for
Tom at the boys’ school, and for herself at the
girls’ school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was so tired that night when bedtime
came that she fell asleep directly her head
touched the pillow, and she slumbered dreamlessly
until morning. It was early when she
woke, and sitting up in bed she thought of all
the things that were before her in the day.
She wondered what she would say to her father,
and whether she ought to tell him of the arrangement
the Head had made with her. It did not
seem fair that he should have to face a situation
of such gravity without some preparation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell him! Oh, I can’t tell him!” she
murmured distressfully, and then, because lying
still and thinking about it was so intolerable,
she sprang out of bed, beginning to dress with
feverish haste. It was such a comfort to pitch
straight into work, and to lose sight for a little
while of the things which bothered her so
badly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole of the Sixth were to work at
term finals from eleven o’clock until one that
day, and they set off down to the beach at
half-past nine, to bathe and get back for a
little rest before the time for the exam. The
Fourth Form girls had already gone down;
the Fifth were sitting for their finals, and
would go to bathe when their work was done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the group of girls with Miss Groome
turned out of the school gates, they met Dr.
Sedgewick coming in. Dorothy’s heart gave a
great bound when she saw him, for he looked
so tired and so very careworn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Groome stayed with her to speak to
him, while the rest of the girls went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not come to see you at this moment,
Dorothy,” he said, with his hand on her shoulder,
while his gaze travelled over her with great
content. “Your Head has sent a message asking
to see me, and I am going to her now. If
you are back from the beach in good time, I
may have a few minutes with you; and then
later in the day, when your finals are over, we
will have a great time together, and a regular
pow-wow. You are looking fine; it is evident
that work agrees with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dorothy is a very good worker,” said Miss
Groome graciously; and then she hurried on
with Dorothy, to catch up with the girls who
were in front, while Dr. Sedgewick walked on
to the hall door for his interview with the
Head.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap24'>CHAPTER XXIV</h1></div>

<h3>DOROTHY TO THE RESCUE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The girls of the Compton School bathed
from the strip of beach just beyond the
steps and in front of the lock-house. It was
a steep and not very safe bit of shore. But all
the girls could swim fairly well, while some of
them were really expert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fourth Form girls had two mistresses
with them, and they were all in the water,
splashing about with tremendous zest, when
the Sixth, who had come to bathe, arrived on
the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coming up the steps from the lock-house,
they reached the Promenade, and were just
going to spring down the wall to reach the
tents when a shrill cry rang out that Cissie
Wray was drowning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was instant commotion. Some of
the girls who were in the water came hurrying
out, scrambling up the beach in a panic; others
launched themselves into deep water with a
reckless disregard for their own safety, and
swam out to help in the rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy, standing on the edge of the wall,
and looking out over the water, saw an arm
shoot up, then disappear. She saw Miss
Mordaunt, the games-mistress, and Miss
Ball, the mistress of the Fourth, making wild
efforts to reach the place where Cissie Wray
was in trouble; she saw the girls who were in
the water crowding together, getting in the
way of the rescuers, endangering themselves,
and adding to the confusion. Acting on impulse,
she sprang from the wall, then running
down the steep beach, and tearing off her skirt
as she ran, she kicked off her shoes, and running
still, took to the water as lightly as a
duck, going forward with long, even strokes
that carried her swiftly on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go back! go back!” she shouted to the
small girls who were bobbing up and down in
the water, anxious to help. “Get out of the
deep as quickly as you can, and get ready to
make a chain to pull us up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chain-making for rescue was one of the
most usual swimming exercises. Sometimes
half the chain would be straggling up the beach,
and the other half in deep water; then the last
one of the chain would drop limp and passive,
while the chain struggled shorewards with the
helpless one in tow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy’s quick wit had seen that the great
hope of rescue lay in the chain. The tide was
running in fast, and the beach at this point rose
so steeply that a swimmer with a burden was
most fearfully handicapped. Oh! a rescue in
such a sea would be a task of magnitude, and
she suddenly realized that Cissie must have
been very far out. Miss Ball was nearest to
the place where Dorothy had seen the arm
flung up. She was swimming with desperate
haste, but she was not saving her strength in
the least possible way. She was not a strong
swimmer, either, and even if she reached the
little girl, she would not be able to do more
than hold her up in the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mordaunt had been right away at the
outer edge of the group. She had been helping
the younger ones to get more confidence in
their own powers; she had to see these headed
for safety before she could come to the help
of Miss Ball and Cissie, so she was behind
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Ball shot forward, gripped hold of
Cissie by the bathing-dress, and was holding
her fast, when poor, frantic Cissie, with a thin
shriek of pure panic, seized Miss Ball in a
frenzied grip, clinging with all her might, and
choking the Fourth Form mistress by the
tightness of her clutch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy made a wild effort and shot forward.
Would she ever cover the distance that separated
her from the two who were in such dire
peril? She almost reached them—she shot out
an arm to grip Miss Ball, who was nearest; a
great wave heaved up and swept the Fourth
Form mistress farther to the left. Dorothy put
out another spurt; she flung every ounce of
strength she had into the effort; she summoned
all her will power to her aid, and suddenly, just
as she was feeling that she simply could not do
any more, Cissie Wray was flung into reach of
her groping fingers, and she had the little girl fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cissie was still clinging with might and main
to the neck of Miss Ball, who, strangled and
helpless in that suffocating grip, was slowly
beginning to sink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Treading water to keep herself afloat, Dorothy
hung on to Cissie’s bathing-dress with one hand,
and with the other she wrenched the little girl’s
hand from its frantic clasp of Miss Ball’s throat.
Quite well she realized her own danger in
doing this, but she trusted to her swiftness of
movement to be able to elude Cissie’s clutching
fingers. She had seized Cissie well by the
back of the bathing-dress, and was keeping her
at arm’s length. But the trouble now was with
Miss Ball, who, having been so badly choked,
could not regain the strength that had been
squeezed out of her, and was being sucked
down into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy made a clutch at her, and catching
her by the arm, held her fast. “Buck up!”
she said sharply. “Buck up and strike out,
or we’ll all be drowned. Keep afloat a minute;
help is coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Ball had done her bit, and there was no
more do in her. She flung out her hands with
a feeble and spasmodic effort, which amounted
to nothing as far as helping herself went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was in despair. Her own strength
was waning, her heart was beating in a choking
fashion, there was a loud singing in her ears,
and her arms felt as if they were being dragged
out of their sockets. She could not stand the
strain another moment. Where was Miss Mordaunt,
and why did she not come to the rescue?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Ball was sinking—oh! she was surely
sinking. Dorothy felt she could not hold the poor
thing up for another second, for she was having
to keep Cissie afloat too, and Cissie was squirming
and kicking in the most dangerous fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Courage, Dorothy, I am here!” panted a
voice close to her, and realizing that Miss
Mordaunt was close at hand, Dorothy’s courage
began instantly to revive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mordaunt laid hold of Miss Ball, who
was by this time limp and unconscious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you hold Cissie until I come?” panted
Miss Mordaunt, who was moving rapidly to get
the helpless Miss Ball ashore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can manage,” Dorothy called out cheerily.
She put every bit of courage she possessed
into her voice so that Miss Mordaunt might
be helped. There is nothing like courage to
inspire courage, and although the others were
doubtless swimming out to their help, there
was a good distance to cover, and it was a very
choppy sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy shifted Cissie, because the little
girl’s face was so low down that it kept getting
under water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cissie, feeling the movement, and believing
that her rescuer was letting her go, made a
sudden, despairing effort, and gripped Dorothy
round the shoulders. Lucky for Dorothy it was
that the choking grip did not get her round the
throat. It was bad enough as it was, for she
could not move her arms, and was dependent
on her feet for keeping herself and Cissie
from drifting farther out to sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cissie, let go; leave yourself to me—I will
save you!” she panted. But Canute ordering
the waves back from the shore was not more
helpless in altering their course than she was in
making any impression on poor, frantic Cissie.
The child clung like a limpet to a rock; Dorothy
had never felt anything like the clutch of those
thin arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could not hold up against it. She was
being dragged down in spite of her struggles.
Oh! it was awful, awful. Scenes from her past
flashed into the mind of Dorothy as she felt
herself slipping, slipping, and felt the thin arms
about her neck clutching tighter and tighter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly a great peace stole into her
heart; if she had to die in such a way, at least
it would solve the problem of to-morrow. If
she were not there to win the Lamb Bursary,
the governors would not have to be told of that
ugly bit in her father’s past which would shut
her out from taking the Bursary even after
she had won it. Supposing that she did not
win it, and it came to Rhoda, if she were dead
there would be no one to remind Rhoda that
she might not have the Bursary because she
was not fit to hold it. Perhaps her death was
the best way out for them all. Anyhow, she
had no longer strength to struggle—no more
power to hold out against the cramping clutch
of Cissie’s arms; and it was a relief, when one
was so weary, to drop into peace which was
so profound.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap25'>CHAPTER XXV</h1></div>

<h3>SAVED BY THE CHAIN</h3>

<p class='pindent'>There was a wild commotion on the
shore. Following the example of Dorothy,
the Sixth dropped their skirts as they ran, and
kicking off their shoes at the edge of the water,
plunged in. But they were all under control
and acting in concert—no one girl made any
attempt to branch out on her own. They were
acting now under the orders of Miss Groome,
who, also skirtless and shoeless, was standing
in the shallow of the water, directing the work
of the chain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep to the left, Hazel,” she called—“more
to the left; keep within touch of the
Fourth’s chain, but don’t foul them—don’t
foul them, whatever you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hazel was the first of the chain; clinging to
her was Joan Fletcher, a powerful swimmer,
and calm in moments of crisis—an invaluable
helper at a time like this. Following her
came Daisy Goatby, blubbering aloud because
of the peril of those out there, a girl who
turned pale and ran away when a dog yelped
with pain at being trodden upon. She hated
to be obliged to look on suffering—the thought
of any one in extremity made a coward of her—but
she could obey orders. Miss Groome had
ordered her into the chain, and she would
cling to the girl who was in front of her even
though she felt her life was being battered out
of her. Dora Selwyn was behind her. Rhoda
was also somewhere at the back of that wriggling
procession, with Margaret and Jessie Wayne.
They had reached the chain of plucky Fourths;
they were encouraging the kids to hold on,
and bidding them not come farther, but rest,
treading water until the time for action came.
The Sixth pushed ahead with all their strength.
They could not swim so fast, hampered by each
other; but it was safety first, and they had to
obey orders if their work was to succeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mordaunt struggled towards them, holding
the unconscious Miss Ball in a tense grip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you get her ashore, girls? I must go
to Dorothy,” she panted; and thrusting Miss
Ball within the grabbing clutch of the two first
girls, she struck out again to reach Dorothy,
who was dropping low in the water, dragged
down by the grip of poor Cissie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hazel, with a dexterous twist of her arm,
passed Miss Ball to Joan, who did not release
her grip of the unconscious mistress until Daisy
had hold of her and was passing her to Dora.
This passing was the extreme test of the power
of the chain. It would have been a comparatively
easy thing to have towed her ashore. In
that case, however, they would not have been
on hand to help Miss Mordaunt with Dorothy
and Cissie. So they had to pass their burden,
and to do it as quickly as they could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hazel never looked behind her—she did not
speak even; but, lightly treading water, she
waited until Miss Mordaunt could reach her.
Even then she would have to hold her place,
for Cissie would have to be passed before they
could tow Dorothy ashore. And it took time—oh,
what an awful time it took!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mordaunt was coming towards them.
She was holding Dorothy, to whom Cissie
clung with the fierce clutch of despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We cannot pass Cissie along—she is too
frightened,” panted Miss Mordaunt, as she
reached Hazel with her burden, and clung
to the chain for a minute to get back her
breath. “Dorothy is so frightfully done, too;
but she will bear that clutch until we can get
her ashore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can pass Dorothy along, with Cissie
clinging to her,” said Hazel, raising herself
a little in the water, and reaching out her hand
to get a grip of Dorothy. “Can you swim
alongside, Miss Mordaunt, to see that Cissie
does not slip away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be best,” agreed Miss Mordaunt,
and striking out, she swam slowly along the
chain of girls as they one after the other
accepted and thrust forward the helpless two.
When Dora, fourth from the end, laid hold of
Dorothy, Hazel swung slowly round in the
water, and swimming up behind Dorothy
seized her on the other side, holding on to her,
and helping to push her from girl to girl as the
chain accepted and passed her on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cissie was not struggling at all now, though
the tightness of her clutch never relaxed; she
was realizing that she was being rescued, and
her panic was dropping from her. She was
acutely conscious, and her black eyes looked
so frightened and mournful that no one had
the heart to reproach her for all the peril into
which her wild panic had brought the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fourth had managed to hold the chain
without a break, and mightily proud they were
of their prowess. They even raised a cheer
when the last of the Sixth came out of the
water; but it died away as they saw Dorothy
lying helpless on the beach, while Miss Ball,
at a little distance, was being wrapped in
blankets by the woman from the lock-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was not unconscious; she was only
so battered and beaten by the struggle in the
water that just at the first she could not lift
a finger to help herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Ball was coming round, so the woman
from the lock-house said, and she offered her
own bed for the use of the two who had suffered
most.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Groome felt that, having borne so much,
it was better for them to bear a little more, and
be carried to where they could have more comfort.
She issued a few crisp orders. The girls,
still in their wet clothes, ran to obey. Then,
while the Fourth dived into their tents to dress
with all the speed of which they were capable,
the Sixth in their wet garments loaded Miss
Ball, Dorothy, and Cissie on to three trucks
which were standing under the wall of the
lifeboat house, and harnessing themselves to
them, started at a brisk pace for the school.
They had no dry clothes on the shore to change
into, and so it was wisdom to move—and to
move as quickly as they could. The woman
from the lock-house had lent them blankets
to cover the half-drowned ones; on to these
blankets they spread skirts; then each girl
wrapping her own skirt round her, they set
off from the shore at the best pace they could
make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy was bumped along on that fearful
hand-truck. She felt she could not bear much
of such transport, and yet knew very well that
she had no strength to walk. She was so tired—so
fearfully weary—that she simply could not
bear anything more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she had been in such danger of drowning,
dragged down by Cissie’s frenzied clasp
of her shoulders, it had seemed such deep
peace and rest, she had not even wanted to
struggle. Then had come the confusion of
Miss Mordaunt’s rough grip, and the girls
dragging her here and pulling her there as
they passed her along. Then had come the
moment when she was hauled to safety up the
steep shingly beach. How the stones had
hurt her as she lay! Yet even that was as
nothing to this. At least she had been able to
lie still on the stones, but now the life was
being bumped out of her! She could certainly
stand no more! She must shriek—she
must do something to show how intolerable
it all was——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Dorothy, it looks as if you had been
getting it rough. Have you been competing for
a medal from the Humane Society, or just
doing a swimming stunt off your own bat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy opened her eyes with a little cry
of sheer rapture. “Oh, Daddy, Daddy, I had
forgotten you were here! I can’t bear this old
truck one minute longer—I can’t, oh, I can’t!”
she wailed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Sedgewick had been warned by the girl
who had run on ahead of the procession to tell
matron of what was coming, and he had met
the girls and the hand-trucks down the lane
a little beyond the school grounds. He gave a
rapid glance round to size up the possibilities
of the situation. Catching sight of the little
gate into the grounds which would cut off a
big piece of the way, he called to them to open
it, and stooping down, he lifted Dorothy from
the truck, swinging her over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guide me by the shortest way to the san,”
he said to the nearest girl; and while she ran
on ahead of him, he followed after her, carrying
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am so heavy, you will never manage it,”
she protested, yet half-heartedly, for it was
such a delightful change to be borne along like
this after that awful bumping on the truck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I shall be able to hold out,” he
answered, laughing at her distress, and then
he passed in at the door of the san, where the
matron met him, and showed him where to
carry Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hours after that were a confusion of
pain and weariness, a succession of deep sleeps
and sudden, startled wakings. Then presently
Dorothy came out of a bad dream of being
dragged down to the bottom of the sea by
Cissie, and awoke to find a light burning, and
her father sitting in an easy-chair near her bed,
absorbed in a paper—or was it a book?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her senses were confused—she did not seem
as if she could be sure of anything; and there
was something bothering her very badly, yet
she could not quite remember what it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy, is it really you?” she asked half-fearfully.
It was in her mind that she might be
dreaming, and that it was not her father who
was sitting there, only a fancy her imagination
had conjured up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Sedgewick dropped the paper he had
been reading, and came quite close to the
bed, stooping down over her, and slipping
his fingers along her wrist in his quiet, professional
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better, are you?” he asked cheerfully,
and his eyes smiled down at her, bringing
a choking sob into her throat. The heavy
sleep was clearing from her now, and she
was remembering the big trouble which lay
behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Daddy, I can’t bear it!” she wailed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter?” he asked in sudden
concern. “Have you pain anywhere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am all right; there is nothing the
matter with me,” she burst out wildly. “It
would have been better if I had gone down
with Cissie, when I was so nearly done; it
would have saved all the explaining that would
have to come after.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What explaining?” he asked quietly, and
then he dragged his chair closer to the bed, and
leaning over her, gently stroked the hair back
from her forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lay quite still for a few seconds, revelling
in the peace and comfort that came from his
touch. Then, wrenching her head from under
his hand, she asked anxiously, “Daddy, you
have seen the Head—do you think I shall win
the Lamb Bursary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I very much hope you will,” he answered.
“The Head, of course, could make no hard-and-fast
pronouncement, but there seems not
very much doubt about the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy’s brows contracted—there was such
a world of misery in her heart that she felt
as if she would sink under the weight of it.
“Oh, I wish I had not enrolled! I wish I
had not come to Compton!” she burst out
distressfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you wish that?” he asked quietly.
“I thought you had been so happy here, and
you have certainly done well—far, far better
than Tom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, poor Tom! What have you done with
him and with all the others?” she asked,
catching at anything which seemed as if it
might put off for a minute the necessity of
explaining to her father her trouble about the
Lamb Bursary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Sedgewick laughed, and to her great
relief there was real amusement in the sound.
“We all agreed—and there were fifteen of us
to agree, mark you—that we had absolute confidence
in Dr. Cameron’s methods in dealing
with boys. We felt the affair was a problem we
would rather leave him to solve free-handed,
and we have left their punishment to him.
They are all to return next term, and he will
decide on what course to take with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t they be punished in any way now?”
she asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, in a way, I suppose,” he answered.
“They will, of course, lose all conduct marks,
because they were acting in known defiance
of regulations—that goes without saying. The
great majority of us were in favour of flogging,
but our suggestion met with no encouragement
from the Head. He told us there were some
things for which flogging was a real cure, but
gambling was not one of them. The only real
and lasting cure for gambling was to lift the
boy to a higher level of thought and outlook—in
short, to fill his life so full of worthier things
that the love of gambling should be fairly
crowded out. He argued, too, that if it were
crowded out in youth, it would not have much
chance to develop later on in life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds like common sense,” said Dorothy,
turning a little on her pillow, and looking
at the shaded night lamp as if the softened
glow might show her a clear way through her
own problems. Then she asked, with a timid
note in her voice, “So you are not being
anxious about Tom any more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not say that,” Dr. Sedgewick
answered quickly. “You know, Dorothy, a
doctor never gives up hope while there is life
in a patient; so one should never give up hope
of recovery of one suffering from—what shall
I call it?—spiritual disease. We will say that
Tom has shown a tendency to disease. But
checked in its first stages—arrested in development—he
may be entirely cured before he
reaches full manhood. That is what I am
hoping, and what those other fathers are hoping
and believing too. We feel that the discipline
of school is the best medicine for them at the
present stage, and that is why we are so content
to leave the whole business in the hands of
Dr. Cameron.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy lay silent for a minute or two, and
again her eyes sought the soft glow from the
lamp. Then making a desperate effort, she
made her plunge. “Daddy,” she whispered,
catching at his hand and resting her cheek
upon it, “Daddy, I have got a trouble—a real,
hefty-sized trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you have,” he answered gravely, and
then he sat silent, waiting for her to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How hard it was! Why did he not help
her? She held his hand tighter still. Oh! if
only she could make him understand how it
hurt her to speak of that old story to him!
And yet it had to be done! She could not in
honour take the Bursary, knowing herself disqualified
for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had you not better out with it, and get it
over, Dorothy?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gasped, and suddenly burst out with
a jerk, “Daddy, Mrs. Wilson told me you had
been sent to prison for a fortnight when you
were a young man, and the rules of enrolment
for the Lamb Bursary candidates state specially
that girls cannot compete whose parents have
been in prison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was out now—out with a vengeance—and
Dorothy hid her face so that she might not
have to see the pain she had caused. So
strained was she that it seemed a long, long
time before her father spoke, and when he did,
his voice seemed to come from a great distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Wilson made a little mistake; it was
not I who went to prison, but my cousin
Arthur,” he was saying. “It was Arthur who
was driving home from the dance that night,
and I was sitting beside him trying to hold
him back from his mad progress. You would
have spared yourself a lot of suffering, Dorothy,
if you had come to me with that old story when
you were home last vacation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you have never been in prison?”
cried Dorothy, her voice rising in a shout of
sheer joyfulness. “And I can have the Mutton
Bone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have to win it first,” Dr. Sedgewick
reminded her.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap26'>CHAPTER XXVI</h1></div>

<h3>DOROTHY GETS THE MUTTON BONE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In consequence of the trouble at the bathing
place, and the tired and chilled condition
of the Sixth, the examination for finals was put
off until next morning at eight o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Sedgewick had said that Dorothy would
certainly not be fit to sit for it; but when the
Sixth went into early breakfast at seven o’clock
Dorothy joined them. She was a bit shaky
still, and she looked rather white, but there
was such radiant happiness in her eyes that
she seemed fairly transfigured by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The examination was over by ten o’clock,
and the girls dispersed to amuse themselves
in any way they liked best. Cissie Wray fell
upon Dorothy as she came out of the examination
room—literally fell upon her—hugging
her with ecstasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dorothy, Dorothy, are you better? Oh, I
want to say ‘Thank you!’—I want to shout it
at you; and yet it does not seem worth saying,
because it is so little to all I feel inside—for
your goodness in saving me yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Cissie, you were badly scared,” said
Dorothy, and she shivered a little even in the
warm sunshine as she thought of the frenzied
clutch of Cissie’s thin arms and the agony in
her big black eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it was dreadful, dreadful! I don’t
ever want to go into the sea again, though I
am not afraid in the swimming bath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is Miss Ball?” asked Dorothy, wanting
to get Cissie’s attention away from the
previous day’s terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is better, but she is not up yet. And
the girls say I nearly drowned her as well as
myself, and that we should both have been
dead if it had not been for you! Oh dear, how
awful it was! I can’t bear to think about it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then don’t think about it,” said Dorothy,
looking down at Cissie with kindness in her
eyes. “I can see my father coming by the
shrubbery path—shall we go and meet him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rather!” cried Cissie, skipping along
by the side of Dorothy. “Dr. Sedgewick is
a dear; he took such lovely care of me yesterday,
and teased me about wanting to be a
mermaid. I think he is the most wonderful
doctor I have ever seen. But I have never had
a doctor before that I can remember—so, of
course, I have not had much experience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cissie seized upon one of the doctor’s arms,
while Dorothy held the other, and they took
him all round the grounds. They showed him
the gymnasium, the archery and tennis courts,
the bowling green, and all the other things
which made school so pleasant. Then Cissie
had to go off to a botany examination, which
was the last of the term’s work for the Fourth,
and Dorothy strolled with her father to the
seat under the beech tree that overlooked the
boys’ playing-fields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have sent a wire to your mother to say
that I shall not be home until the night train,”
said Dr. Sedgewick, slipping his arm round
Dorothy as she sat with her head resting against
his shoulder. “Your Head says that I must
stay for the prize-giving this afternoon. If I
skip tea, I think I can manage the five o’clock
train, which will put me in town with time to
catch the last train to Farley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then Tom and I shall get home to-morrow.
Oh! how lovely it will be.” Dorothy nestled
a little closer in her father’s arm, and thought
joyfully that now there was no shadow on her
joy of home-coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet you have been very happy here?”
The doctor looked round upon the grounds
and the playing-fields as he spoke, and thought
he had never seen a pleasanter place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed I have—it has been lovely!” said
Dorothy with satisfying emphasis. “It has
been good to be near Tom. Only the worst
of it has been that he did not seem to need
me very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom will be happier when he has cut his
wisdom teeth,” said Dr. Sedgewick. “By
the way, Dorothy, what other fairy stories did
Mrs. Wilson tell you of my past? I should
think the poor lady’s brain must have been
weakening, though, in truth, it was never very
strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think she told me any others,”
answered Dorothy. “I thought she seemed
very fond of your cousin, Arthur Sedgewick,
by the way she spoke of him. Daddy, why did
you never tell us anything about him, and why
did mother refuse to talk about him when I
mentioned the matter to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He turned out such a detrimental, poor
fellow, that your mother hated the very mention
of him, especially as it laid such a burden
on my shoulders for years. When he died he
left debts, and he left an invalid wife. For
the sake of the family honour the debts had to
be paid, and the poor wife had to be supported
until she died. There was good reason for
your mother’s unwillingness to talk about him.
It was getting into bad habits as a boy that was
his undoing.” The doctor sat for a while in
silence, and then he said, “It is because of
Arthur having made such a mess of life that I
am so glad to leave Tom here for another couple
of years—he will have learned many things by
that time.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The lecture hall was crammed to its utmost
capacity. Many visitors occupied the chairs
in the centre of the hall, while round the outskirts,
in the corners, along the front of the
dais, and everywhere that it was possible to
find a place to sit, or stand, girls in white frocks
were to be seen. Prize-giving for the boys had
been the previous afternoon—a function shorn
of much of its glory, for the double reason that
the disaster on the beach in the morning had
taken away much of the joyfulness of the girls,
and the fact that twenty-five of the boys would
not receive even the prizes they had earned,
because of the trouble in regard to the night-club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys who had come over to the prize-giving
at the girls’ school were accommodated
in the gallery. There were not so many of
them present as was usual on such occasions,
but those who had come did their loudest when
it came to the cheering. The wife of the M.P.
for the division gave away the prizes; and as
she was gracious and kindly in her manner, she
received a great ovation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy had the conduct medal—she had
also the first prize for English Literature; but
that was all. The fact of having to be an all-round
worker was very much against the
chances of winning prizes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed a fearfully long time to wait until
all the prizes had been given. Then the wife
of the M.P. sat down, and the legal-looking
gentleman who managed the Lamb Bursary
stepped on to the dais. He had a paper in his
hand; but he had to stand and wait so long
for the cheering to subside that the Head rose
in her place and came forward to the edge of
the dais, holding up her hand for silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once a hush dropped on the place—a
hush so profound and so sudden that it gave
one the sensation of having had a door shut
suddenly on the great noise of the past few
minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in his quiet but penetrating voice the
governor of the Bursary read the names of the
candidates in the order in which they had
enrolled, with the total of marks to each name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy sat white and rigid. As the names
were read out she tried to remember them, to
determine, which girl had the most, but she was
so confused that she could not hold the figures
in her head. When the seven names had been
read there was a pause, and again the hush
was so profound that the humming of a bee
in one of the windows sounded quite loud by
contrast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have therefore great pleasure,” went on
the cool, rather didactic tones of the governor,
“in stating that the Lamb Bursary for this
year goes to Dorothy Ida Sedgewick, who has
won it, not by a mere squeeze, but with a
hundred marks above the candidate nearest
to her in point of number.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now indeed there was a riot of cheering,
of clapping, and of jubilation generally, until,
standing up, the whole crowd of white-frocked
girls burst into singing,—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“For she’s a jolly good fellow,</p>
<p class='line0'>Who well has earned the prize.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Then they linked hands, joining in “Auld
Lang Syne,” in compliment to their visitors, this
merging at the end into the National Anthem,
after which the visitors were to be entertained
to tea on the lawn. But Dr. Sedgewick had
to hurry away to catch his train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy went with him as far as the little
gate at the end of the grounds through which
she had been carried the previous day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had not much to say for herself, but the
radiant content of her face was just the reflection
of the happiness in her heart. She
was thinking how differently she would have
felt but for that talk with her father last
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be good news for your mother,
Dorothy. You have made us very happy,”
said Dr. Sedgewick in a moved tone as he bade
her good-bye at the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy, it is just lovely, and I am so happy
about it all,” she said. “Of course it is hard
for Margaret that she did not win; but she is
going to stay at Compton another year, so she
will have her chance again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not Margaret who was next to you,
but that rather bold-looking girl, Rhoda Fleming,”
her father said, thinking she had made a
mistake as to who was next to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy smiled. “Oh, I am not sorry for
Rhoda—I did not want her to win,” she said
quietly. “Perhaps I should not have worked
so hard myself if it had not been because I
knew I had to beat her somehow, for the
honour of the school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she was your friend if she inspired
you to greater effort,” he answered, and dropping
another kiss on her forehead hurried down
the road to catch his train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy went back to the others. She did
her part in waiting on the visitors. She was
here, she was there—and everywhere it was
kindly congratulation she had for her hard work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on, when the visitors were taking leave
of the Head, Dorothy, alone for a moment, was
pounced upon by Rhoda, who said sharply,
“So you did beat me after all—I was afraid
you would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was bound in honour to beat you if I
could,” Dorothy answered, looking her straight
in the face. “My father says I ought to be
grateful to you for making me work so hard.
And I am. I am very grateful to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rhoda went very red in the face. A look of
something like shame came into her eyes as
she turned away in silence.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:3em;'>THE END</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
